"Karen of Sullivan, IN","The individuals I dealt with were very kind and answered questions so that I understood. I received the Medical Guardian equipment in a short period of time. I dropped it (in Indiana). One always wonders if there will be an immediate response if needed. I had one. While in Florida, I dropped it (arthritic hands). I received another immediate response. It is a great travel companion. I consider this purchase a success.","Original review: March 12, 2022"
"Susan of Rothbury, Michigan",The device worked very well for my mother the choice of a necklace or a wrist band was very nice to have. It allowed her to stay independent much longer because if she fell help would be on the way immediately. They always called me at home to notify me that her device had been activated. Peace of mind... priceless.,"Original review: April 1, 2021"
"Frank of Westminster, CA","I enjoyed using the Medical Guardian smartwatch. It does everything as advertised. I like being able to get the local temperature and knowing how many steps I've taken for my morning walks. Every product has room for improvement, I would hope to see features such as measuring your body temperature, your heart rate, blood pressure and blood oxygen.","Original review: Sept. 1, 2022"
"Blake of Star, ID","The customer service is excellent from purchasing to installing. The sales rep and customer service took their time, researched and made sure all tests were performed correctly. Unfortunately the fall button failed the test and they must send out a new one. I am still wearing it in case I do fall. It allows me to push the button, if I pass out it will be of no use. Customer service promptly shipped a new button to me. I would recommend Medical Guardian to others because of their fantastic customer service and the cost is reasonable. I did extensive research and Medical Guardian was always at the top of the recommendation list.","Original review: Aug. 5, 2022"
"Linda of Glenwood, MD","I've been very pleased so far. Had one mishap where accidentally hit the button and they responded immediately. A couple weeks ago, got a call from them to check on me... I hadn't done my own check to ensure the device was working so they called me to check I'll be going to England in Sept, so that will be the real test. We shall see. For now, I'm very pleased with it. It charges easily. I can wear it either on provided lanyard or clipped to my waist. Like both ways. Not too expensive either.","Original review: July 25, 2022"
"Judith of Las Vegas, NV","I was looking for a medical device that I could have with fall alert protection. Medical Guardian is supplying me with this protection. I was not happy with the first equipment I received but when called to set up the system, I was told of optional pieces. I am now thrilled with my small pendant and the system. Hopefully I will only have to press the alarm button once a month for a test.","Original review: Feb. 27, 2022"
"Steve of Woodward, OK","It is very easy to set up. We got both the wrist unit and the neck pendant, so if we get tired of one, we can switch. Three dollars more per month to add that option. We are pleased and will recommend it to our friends. I sure hope that Medical Guardian does not sell my phone number or e-mail!!! THAT would piss me off. !!!!","Original review: Feb. 7, 2022"
"Ila of Grass Valley, CA","I have been trying to cancel my membership for over 6 weeks apparently no one cares once they got my money. Now, I'm fighting for a complete reimbursement of my money!! I want my money back!! I want my money back!! I want my money back!! ASAP.","Original review: Aug. 21, 2022"
"Karen of Rowley, MA",Our experience was great when we purchased this system. We thought we were all set and 90 year old mom felt safer in her own home. 2 years later she fell in her kitchen and pressed the button for 3 1/2 hours and got nothing. Thank God my brother came and found her. She broke her hip and is going to rehab but has expressed she is not safe at home because the device did not work. She would rather go to a nursing home than return home. ,"Original review: Aug. 8, 2022"
"Gina of South Bend, IN","Purchased a Medical Alert System for my mother, at the time 86. It was supposed to have ""fall protection"". After she fell, no detection, we were advised the one they sent us did not have the fall protection. I had been paying for that for almost 5 years. Last year they offered me a small credit. I always pay per year vs per month. Sadly, my mother passed away. Instead of refunding 4 months -- they told me the previous credit I was given offset any refund I would have gotten. Obviously --- they didn't care why they had given me the previous credit. Also charged me a $50 restocking fee -- which no one conveniently mentioned. I prefer to not do business with companies who don't treat customers fairly. I would not recommend Medical Guardian.","Original review: July 11, 2022"
"Rita of Poiniana, FL","So far this unit has performed as stated. I like that the monitor is loud and easily heard. I have the additional fall monitor for my husband which enables me to go out to the pool or grocery store knowing if he falls, I will be contacted by phone.","Original review: July 7, 2022"
"Lisa of Jacksonville, FL",When my dad died I notified them and was given a RMA to return the equipment. They received it 5 days later. I have provided the tracking number multiple times and they still have not processed my return almost 2 months after getting the equipment back. They are still billing me. I have contacted them several times and get a different story each time. They collected an additional payment and have not refunded it back to my card. The monitoring services were great but prepared for a nightmare when you try to cancel the service.,"Original review: June 18, 2022"

"Laura of Carlsbad, CA",My husband fell and the device did not recognize that he fell. Luckily he wasn’t hurt and neighbors saw him and did help him up. This is the second time that this happened. First time I excused as he was sitting in a chair and slipped to the ground. Thought maybe he was too low recognize that he fell.,"Original review: May 29, 2022"
"Patricia of Jeffersonville, IN",The price is reasonable compared to all others that I checked into and they walked me through the set up with no problems at all. I was a little disappointed that after I paid in full there were all kinds of discounts hitting my inbox.,"Original review: May 19, 2022"
"A. of San Jose, CA",Fall detection is a main part of this device in case of the stroke. I use this device for some time until noticed that fall detection doesn't work. It doesn't work even after upgrading to a new device. Customer representatives rare pick up the phone on Saturdays.,"Original review: May 18, 2022"
"Connie of Palmetto Bay, FL",I advised the initial person I spoke to I had a METAL roof..The device they sent (that I purchased) does NOT work with the metal roof situation -New device was to come Friday (2 days ago). Has not ... Have no idea what the device they are sending is-but feel the salesperson SHOULD have advised what I wanted would not work with metal roofs...It was CLEAR to him a few times CELL DOES NOT Work IN The house because of a metal roof--WHY didn't he tell me I couldn't get what I wanted?,"Original review: May 16, 2022"
"Robert of Fort Lauderdale, FL","I received my new medical watch a week ago and when I was setting it up I could not get the steps to work. Then called the rep that sold me the watch and he did not know how to setup the steps and he put me through to customer care, a lady got on the phone and she was unsure how to set it up so she put me on hold for 12 minutes then came back and tried a few things with me, still did not work, put me on hold again for another 11 minutes then came back and said someone would call me before 5pm today. Received a call a 4pm and was told they would be sending me a new watch and I would have to return the one I have to them. Overall I have wasted 2 hours of my day with the customer care and salesman","Original review: May 5, 2022"
"Thelma of Lancaster, PA",Needs better battery technology and had to glue string back to clasp already with a hot glue gun. Paid a lot of money and had to fix it in the first 6 months. Considering looking for a different one in the future. Not sure I would recommend this one to friends or family. Idk!?,"Original review: May 2, 2022"
"Elizabeth of Durham, NC",Contents of purchase arrived intact and on time. However the lock box did not arrive with the correct 4 digit code. Once installed on the door it wouldn't open. The tech support said the company dropped the ball and said we should call a locksmith to remove the box. NO. Very disappointed in their response.,"Original review: March 30, 2022"
"Ricky of Princeton, NC",The first call I made to them was a nightmare. I got a salesman that thought I was too old or too dumb to figure him out. One of the final questions I asked him was if I bought the equipment from Walmart was it going to be the same monitoring. I already knew the answer and could have bought it cheaper at Walmart but he decided it was just easier to end the conversation and say I would have to talk to Walmart about that.... the guy was only looking to out talk me and make a quick sale. My second call was completely different and I managed to get all questions answered and order placed. This time the man on the other end was a true professional. Now just waiting on the equipment and hopefully all things will go well. 3 stars is not very fair but the first call was a 1 star and the second was a 5 so wish I had never called the first time.,"Original review: March 24, 2022"
"Michael of Lakeland, FL","I have not received my product as of yet. Oh, I do so however look forward to using these device for my mother. I will be pleased to do a follow-up as soon as I received my device which I as of yet have not.","Original review: March 22, 2022"
"Sean of Boulder Creek, CA",The issue I’ve had as a caregiver for my mom is the App… It is too hard to access and won’t even open up most of the time. Read the App Store reviews for more details. The unit itself is great and so easy to Use and there was no installation. Just charge it up and go!,"Original review: March 10, 2022"

"Carol of Brecksville, OH","I spoke to Allison. She was well informed and very polite. She answered all my questions and made me feel comfortable making my decision to go with Guardian.I received my Mini Guardian three days ago. I charged the battery then spoke with a women who went over my instructions. Very easy to set up. Thank you, Carol","Original review: Feb. 21, 2022"
"Thelma of Lancaster, PA",Wish the battery lasted longer than 5 days between charges! Even 2 more days would be nice. That way it's only once a week instead every 5 days which would make it easier to remember to do as you could pick 1 day a week and that would be designated charge your battery day!,"Original review: Feb. 17, 2022"

"Donna of Bridgewater, MA",When they updated from G4 to G5 they changed out the machines and the wrist bands. The new wrist bands have no metal clasp. The have a plastic push nubbins. The don't stay on. My mom hates it. She called and they said they would send old bracelet. She got new ones again. Then I called and ask her to be switched back to 4G with the better bracelet. I was told it would ship next day. She got it and it the SAME one she already has. These are elderly people. Customer service is terrible. We are switching companies. Her neighbor is having the same issue. Shame on Medical Guardian for sending non senior citizen bracelets.,"Original review: Oct. 14, 2021"
"Andrew of Little Rock, AR","I buy few medicine and they give me on-time delivery. This is really good. they also reply me instantly. I think they are very responsive about the time. Overall, the experience is good and I would recommended everyone. Thanks.","Original review: Sept. 9, 2021"
"Stephanie of Saint Paul, MN","I was very excited about the Freedom Guardian Watch because it was everything I needed for my mother. I read the reviews and did my research then placed my order. This arrived in about 5 days and I was quick to charge it for the night so I could set it up in the morning. I woke up, made my coffee and called the company to activate it. Now, I live in the suburb of a large city and getting a phone signal is not a problem. This was a problem for the watch so the Tech asked if I could try standing outside to see if this would help. It seems that a metal roof or siding will block the signal (I have neither). Well, there is freezing rain and sub zero but I took one for the team and went outside (really the doorway and held the watch out further) this changed nothing. The watch would not connect to the signal of AT&T. ","Original review: Feb. 5, 2021"
"Paul of Long Beach, NY","My mother has the MiniGuardian, and recently fell (first incident with the unit). The system did in fact summon an ambulance crew (my mother pressed the button). But the crew could not get into the house for 15 minutes -- until I noticed flashing red lights from the window and opened the front door (I was actually home, but was pre-occupied in a different part of the house). What about the lockbox code? The crew was told by the dispatcher there was no such code. But after the incident, I called customer service and inquired about the lockbox code and the rep immediately told it to me! But the dispatcher (called the next day by pressing the button on the device) stated there was no lockbox code.","Original review: Dec. 3, 2020"
"Shannon of Wichita, KS","The Medical Guardian equipment was bulky and heavy, and my mom didn't like it; we tried two different products, so we gave it all a shot. I received confirmation that the returned equipment was received on 8/6/2020 and was told to allow a ridiculous 30 days for a refund. I went along, but when I hadn't received a refund my next credit card bill, I called on 9/21/20. Still no refund on 9/24, so I submitted a dispute via my credit card company. On 10/11/2020 the credit card company reversed its refund and told me the dispute was still in play. ","Original review: Oct. 21, 2020"
"Sarah of Manchester, ME","I order the home medical alert system for my mother end of 2019. I was told when I purchased the system and paid for a year of services that I had 30 days to try the product, and would receive a full refund if I was not satisfied. I made sure the warranty was for 30 days because this was a Christmas gift, and I knew my mother would be leaving for 2 weeks the day after Christmas, so it would be at least 2 weeks before she could try it out. I asked extensive questions about the warranty and return policy, and because of the answers I received I was comfortable paying for a year of services. That was a mistake.","Original review: Oct. 18, 2020"
"Elizabeth of Richmond, VA","I can't get up when I fall. I now have Medical Guardian's device that goes around my neck. It goes when I go. I haven't had to use it, but so far it's easy to handle. The Medical Guardian team has been very cooperative and very easy to deal with.","Original review: Sept. 3, 2020"
"Joseph of Wellington, FL","I'm 82 years old, living alone and I have issues as well as a pacemaker. I wanted to make sure I was covered and so I got a medical alert. I got a Medical Guardian and put a lockbox outside my house in case the fire department has to come in. Medical Guardian would notify them so at nights, I have their device around my neck and by the bed. During the day, I have my Medical Guardian watch on. Having it makes me feel secure and safe.","Original review: Sept. 2, 2020"
"Robert of Marion, AR","I had a ministroke and I would pass out and lose my balance. I live out in the country in Marion, Arkansas where phone service is not doing well. I got myself a cell phone that has a button that I push when I have an emergency. When I had a ministroke, I used the dial and somebody came by and helped me out. The ambulance came and took me to the hospital. When I got out, one of my children said something about getting me a push button. Now I have a device on my neck from Medical Guardian. The button is there for me when I need it. I also have a button in each room.","Original review: Sept. 2, 2020"
"Barbara of Oklahoma City, OK",I had several falls a few months ago and then I had to have a leg amputated ‘cause of an infection. I needed a medical alert device in case I fall some more. My experience with Medical Guardian has been really good. I have no problems at all. I’m glad I have it.,"Original review: Sept. 2, 2020"
"Rita of Temple, TX","My husband is on rehab and I live by myself at the present time, and my son felt that I would be safer having this device. He got it from Medical Guardian early part of July. I have not had to use it but when I first got it, I unconsciously activated it. The answering machine answered right away. I felt so embarrassed that I had to tell them that but I like that they responded readily. I wish though that the device could be in every room. The main machine is in the living room but in the bedroom, I would have to rely on just punching the button. Then, they would call the contact number but I would not be able to chat with them. I wear the button around my neck and I had to pull it up a little bit because it rested in my stomach. Every time I leaned against something, it got activated. I had to raise it up, so it would be closer to my breastbone.","Original review: Sept. 1, 2020"
"Virginia of Harrison, OH","My daughter bought me a Medical Guardian after I fell one night. Though I'm not too enthused about wearing the device, I wear it every day.","Original review: Sept. 1, 2020"
"Bob of Croton-On-Hudson, NY","I'm alone in my big house. If anything happens to me, I wanted a way of contacting someone other than by using a telephone. My neighbor checked with several companies and found Medical Guardian to be most successful. She came to my place with all the information and we established the account. So far, I don't like my Medical Guardian much. It keeps opening and the long thing that goes around my wrist keeps flapping around and getting into everything. I have to stop everything I'm doing and put it back with things that hold it down. Still, it's alright and I'm very satisfied with it.","Original review: Sept. 1, 2020"
"Sue of Anderson, IN","My father-in-law is elderly, lives alone and has been falling some. My brother-in-law looked online and Medical Guardian seemed to have the best rating and so, we went with it. My father-in-law and brother-in-law tested the button and everything is positive. We don't have any problems with it. Somebody came up and asked us about it and we've already given one referral.","Original review: Aug. 31, 2020"
"Jill of Groton, CT","On my 87th birthday, my two daughters got together and looked into getting me a medical alert device. They went with Medical Guardian but so far I've found their device very heavy. I need a bell around my neck and it's been very hot and humid. I don't like that the string around my neck is going to get covered with sweat and will get dirty. If Medical Guardian could make the cord around my neck or the device detachable such that it could be clipped to a belt, it would be an improvement. It would also help if I get someone with me who understands it. The device came through the mail and my daughters weren't around.","Original review: Aug. 31, 2020"
"Donna of Richmond, IN","I've had several falls so my son got me a medical alert device. He looked through several medical alert device companies and device on Medical Guardian. I used their necklace unit for a while and then I shifted to their bracelet. The bracelet started to bother me so I went back to the necklace. The necklace is so long though that I cut it a little bit to make it fit. This way, I wouldn't have all that cord hanging down. The unit I have functions in my home until 1,300 feet away. While I would like for it to help me outside of home too, I'm satisfied so far.","Original review: Aug. 31, 2020"
"David of Forked River, NJ","My father lives by himself and getting up in age, which was why I got him a medical alert device. I liked Medical Guardian’s rating and signing up with them was simple. My father told me he has tried the button, and his only complaint is that it is large and there's a red flashing light on it.","Original review: Aug. 30, 2020"
"Margaret of Franklin Township, NJ","I have fear of falling. I’ve fallen three times in a row, and each time I had to have a hip replaced. It's been tough times. It was time for me to do something about it. So, we got Medical Guardian. Everything's been good. I haven't fallen, so I haven't had to use it but it's with me all the time. I have it around my neck. I like the feeling of reassurance that I have in case something happens. I feel there's somebody there in case I need them.","Original review: Aug. 30, 2020"
"Leslie of Naples, FL","My mother is under hospice care and she is getting weaker every week. We got her a Medical Guardian and security-wise, she has been fine. We programed the device such that if she falls, the call goes directly to the hospice and they come out to my mother's location. Medical Guardian has been great so far from my experiences with customer service to putting in the alert device.","Original review: Aug. 30, 2020"
"James of Pontiac, IL","I wear my Medical Guardian around my neck and it's been fine so far. I haven't had a need to use it, but it doesn't bother me to wear it. One time, I pushed my button, and then they answered it. It was just a short period of time. They called back and asked if I was all right. I said, ""Yeah. I'm all right. It was just a first time test.”","Original review: Aug. 29, 2020"
"Jeff of Bradenton, FL","My mom's Medical Guardian device has been so far, so good. Everything was good when I set it up. She had some therapist that were coming out. She's had strokes and she's unsteady on her feet. She stays by herself. She's got to stay here once she let the dog out in the pen. She could go outside with her device cause it's like a cellular device. I’m about 10 minutes away from her, but still, if something happens, she can press that button. Even if somebody's breaking in or something, she can press it.","Original review: Aug. 29, 2020"

"Shirley of Westminster, MD","I decided to get a Medical Guardian because I was by myself for a long while, but my sister's with me now. I wanted to make sure that if I would fall or something would happen, I would have somebody to help me. I feel much safer being here, ‘cause I know if something happens, all I have to do is push my little button and somebody will come. I have it around my neck and I wear it all the time.","Original review: Aug. 28, 2020"
"Betty of East Pittsburgh, PA","My daughter decided to get me a medical alert because I'm 95 years old. She wanted it for emergencies. I can't talk too right and I can't do things. I can't walk a lot. When I need to call her, I have my Medical Guardian device on my arm. I have like a watch on my hand. I haven't used it yet for anything but it's a very good thing. I feel safe. Now that I have it, I can get help if it is needed.","Original review: Aug. 28, 2020"
"P. of Ny, NY","The customer service of Medical Guardian has been very good. The sales representatives were easy to deal with. Thankfully, we haven't had to use it yet ‘cause my mother hasn’t fallen yet. But from speaking to a sales representative to installing it, it's been great.","Original review: Aug. 28, 2020"
"J. of Va, VA","My son got me to purchase a Medical Guardian, so I have it in case of an emergency. I keep it beside my bed. I don't wear it because it's a little heavy. My experience with it has been fine. I have not had to use it though.","Original review: Aug. 27, 2020"
"Jean of Naperville, IL","I researched online and liked what they had to say about Medical Guardian. The information on their website stood out. I also liked that their call centers are all in the US, so I knew I would be speaking to somebody who could speak English. Everybody at Medical Guardian was very good at what they did. They spoke clearly, explained things adequately, and they were polite. I did use my device once. I have Parkinson's and I froze. I just needed them to call anybody. I had them call my sister to wake her up so she could come and assist me. It was a positive experience.","Original review: Aug. 27, 2020"
"Nancy of Sylvania, OH","I live alone and I've fallen. My kids thought it would be good if I got the Medical Guardian device. They're happy that I have it and that I use it. Right now, I'm sitting in a metro park and I have the bracelet on, and I have the other part in my purse. They feel that it's money well-spent. However, it's not really comfortable. Especially when it's hot and sticky, it's hard to wear it. It sticks to my arm. It's not like I'm thinking, I don’t like it. I'm just not a jewelry person. But I'm used to it. It's okay. It's made well. I'm glad that I have it and I use it. I'm gonna be 85 this month, so it's a good thing to have.","Original review: Aug. 27, 2020"
"Ronald of Sarasota, FL","I did some research online and Medical Guardian seemed like the best deal. We liked that you're not in a contract and the price. We had it before for temporary and so far, it's great. We needed it at one time and it worked out well. Bob had fallen and I wasn't around. So, he called 911 and they came and helped him up.","Original review: Aug. 26, 2020"
"Merle of Highland Park, IL","I was falling a lot. My children decided for me to have Medical Guardian. They feel very good about it. I don't wear my device but I keep it on my night table.

"Janis of Citrus Springs, FL","My insurance company sent me a medical alert. They sent one of those things that they got to set up a thing in your house and you can only go 500 feet. My mailbox is over 500 feet from my door. My backyard, I have to only go halfway through it. I've never opened it. That was when I went online and got Medical Guardian. I'd rather pay for something that I know is gonna be there when I need it.","Original review: Aug. 26, 2020"
"R. of Mo, MO","The kids said I should get the device from Medical Guardian. Roxanne, my daughter, looked at them and she said that was the one I needed. When my daughter and my daughter-in-law agree on something, it's a whole lot easier to go along with them than it is to argue with them. It’s got to be safer having the device. I've got my cell phone and it works most of the places I am but with that tied around the neck, might not be quite as to drop it. But it’s because of the injury that I got it.

"Tabitha of Waynesville, NC","When my grandmother received her Medical Guardian device, I was the one that was supposed to set it up. But she threw away the box that it came in with the instructions, so we weren't for sure how to set it up. I did save the email, so my husband was kinda sorta messing around with it because we didn't know if the green light was supposed to stay on if it was charged or what was going on. He messed around with it for a few minutes and it ended up calling the help people. When it did, my husband said, “We were just trying to figure it out. We didn't know how to work it, what's going on.” The rep talked him through it and told him that everything was set up and it was ready to go.","Original review: Aug. 25, 2020"
"Gwen of Pigeon, MI","Medical Guardian is working out really well for my mother. She's 89, and I live on the other side of town here, but still, if she would fall in the house, I would want to know about it. She goes outside and tries to pull weeds and all those wonderful little things. She won't listen to us, so we figured this was the next best thing. My older sister picked Medical Guardian out, and we just agreed on it. She went on and evaluated or looked up their ratings on her phone, so she thought this one was the best for what we needed. Mom doesn't really travel anywhere, and she doesn't go anywhere but the house, so we thought this would be perfect for her. She wears her device. She either has the necklace on or she wears the watch. We've been really happy with Medical Guardian.","Original review: Aug. 25, 2020"
"Lisa of Pegram, TN","My mother's 80 years old and still lives alone. She’s had bad vertigo and had a lot of dizzy spells with that. We decided it would be better off to get that where she would have something. In case she fell and nobody was there, she could get help. I looked at the alerts up online and Medical Guardian came up as the number one company. I called to inquire about it. They gave me all that information over the phone right down to the price. So, we decided and went with them. So far, the Medical Guardian has been great. We've had no issues. We've been very satisfied. They were helpful and friendly over the phone.

"Janice of Indianapolis, IN","My mother is 91 so the possibility of falling is increasing. With Medical Guardian, we feel more secure. The device is fine and I can understand and hear the station out of which the person talks but the voice cuts in and out. So, it's hard for my mother to understand. I had to tell her that when she hears them answering, she should tell them, “Ambulance or call my daughter."" We've worked around it but it would be nice if the acoustics were a little easier for older people to understand. It's not coming across clearly and it's not the fault of the person talking to us. It's the equipment.","Original review: Aug. 24, 2020"
"Doris of Rockaway Township, NJ","I got the virus and my friend called Medical Guardian and ordered a device for me, and she had it sent to my house. I live alone and my kids are in California. They were worried about me being alone with the virus. I fell down the front steps with it on. I hurt my shoulder. I couldn't get off the step. People weren't stopping because everybody's afraid of the virus. They knew I had the virus. They're afraid they're gonna get it. So, all the neighbors that were on the beach walking by does not stop to help me up. I was able to call the ambulance and made a lot of trouble getting me up because of the shoulder and my weight. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow because my shoulder is still in bad shape. I can't use the right arm much at all.","Original review: Aug. 24, 2020"
"Becky of Osseo, MN","I have RA, so my joints hurts and sometimes, I fall. I've had other health issues that come along with that. I got Medical Guardian, and my husband really appreciates it especially, when he's not home, he knows that there's at least some contact. We did go for the necklace because I thought that would be the one I'd be most likely to remember to have on and take with me. It's just a little heavy to wear, but it's comfortable.","Original review: Aug. 24, 2020"

"C. of Ca, CA","I had a fall and I’m unsteady on my feet. I got Medical Guardian, and I now have greater sense of safety and security if something should happen. My device is around my neck. I like the fact that it is water-resistant, so I can keep it on in the shower which is important. When I purchased it, they said that the charge would last up to a week. I have found that that doesn't last. It needs to be charged about every four days. And on the neck one, it connects with a magnet. It's not a solid band around your neck. So, I noticed the magnet has pulled apart a couple times when I'm getting dressed. It might be better if they just had it as a solid necklace instead of one that pulled apart with a magnet. While I have not used it yet, I have tested it. The customer service was very good.","Original review: Aug. 23, 2020"
"E. of Ny, NY","I had a stroke and my friend had suggested that I get something. The two of us started to sort of search around what might be best. As far as the cost, Medical Guardian was much more cost effective. Also, we like that it was lighter weight. The Medical Guardian team was great, especially the original person I spoke to. Everybody was so informative in letting us know what was the best thing and what was my best options. I'm very satisfied with my experience.","Original review: Aug. 23, 2020"
"G. of Me, ME","I live alone and I'm old. I got a Medical Guard system and the one I have has a machine on my bedside table. I also wear a push-button around my neck.

So far, the device has been fine and it solves my problem.","Original review: Aug. 23, 2020"
"Gisele of Leominster, MA","I like my Medical Guardian a lot. One time, I decided to clean my clothes. So I took all my clothes to bring in my kitchen, so I could wash it. All of a sudden I heard my name. I thought somebody was in the house. It was the alert, the chain I have in my neck. There's a button there. 'Cause I pressed it. It called the alarm system. I heard the alarm system, ""Are you okay?"" I said, ""Okay. I'm fine. I was supposed to bring my clothes and I was pressing it in my arm, to the kitchen."" So that was working very good. I wear it very well, all the time. I slept with it. I kept it. I took it off when I'm in the shower. But I can keep it in the shower too if I need it. I'm enjoying it. I'm very satisfied with it and I'm very happy. I have the watch too. I can wear it or the necklace.","Original review: Aug. 22, 2020"

I decided I needed something and my daughter did all the checking in with Medical Guardian. I got their device and so far, I put the bracelet unit on at night and put on the necklace one during the daytime. I've been happy with my Medical Guardian. There was a time when I laid it down a little too hard. That set the device off and a little later, my daughter and I heard banging on our door. I had to tell the medics that I accidentally bumped it. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product.","Original review: Aug. 22, 2020"
"Patricia of Bryant, IN","I had severe vertigo that put me in the hospital. My two sons set me up with Medical Guardian. When they were first setting me up, Medical Guardian had to call at a certain time but they didn't get that done. Still, when the call came in my sons understood the rep whom they worked with. Now, I have the key to my house in my lockbox and I carry their device with me all the time in my purse. I keep their other device in my bed and made my husband aware of it. I have improved so much since having vertigo that we considered eliminating Medical Guardian's service. My sons decided to continue it though and we're gonna keep it for a year just in case.","Original review: Aug. 22, 2020"
"Justin of Tarpon Springs, FL","Medical Guardian sold my elderly and infirm mother (81) a device that she did not need, could not afford, and would not have worked for her situation. Then after I - her son and caretaker- promptly returned the device (at our expense) they have to date refused to return the $470 they took from her. She needs this money to pay rent and buy groceries. I feel Medical Guardian is really a wolf in sheep's clothing, preying on elderly fears. Buyer beware!","Original review: Aug. 21, 2020"
"Marie of Brooklyn, NY","I fell last August and I also fell in June. I had always planned to get a medical device, so it motivated me to get it before. My family's happier now that I have one. My son knew someone that had a Medical Guardian. He checked what was the best one and he felt Medical Guardian was. Their reps were very nice. Getting everything set up didn't take long at all. My son set it in motion. I'm pleased with it and I feel reassured that I have it. I haven't had to use it. But I almost was thinking of checking it.","Original review: Aug. 21, 2020"

"Marilyn of Randall, MN","I was not satisfied with my previous medical alert device provider as they did not call the people that were on my list when they needed to. My brother who has Medical Guardian told me all the advantages of having their service. My son took care of signing me up with them and so far I love Medical Guardian. I charge their device every four days when the battery runs out. I thought it would last a week but still it's not hard to charge it. There was a time when I had intestinal bleeding and as soon as I pressed my button, their team answered right away. The fire department got to my location right away. The ambulance didn't take long either and they came from 10 miles away. I'm totally satisfied with the service and I feel really secure with it. The reps are so polite and caring when they answer the phone.","Original review: Aug. 21, 2020"
"Latrina of Memphis, TN",I compared Medical Guardian with a competitor and Guardian fit more both the old and young while the other one was always advertised to old people. Guardian was the one I wanted and I got that. I do the watch and it's fine. I tested it when I first got it and it worked. But I'm pressing it and no one's coming out so maybe something needs to be charged on the watch.,"Original review: Aug. 21, 2020"

So if I fall and my husband isn't here at the time, somebody will know. It’s a more secure feeling having it. If anyone's going to be alone or do not have someone around them all the time, it's a very good idea. I've had to learn as far as putting things in the upper shelf, like lemons or something up high that when I lean in, I can set it off. I've done that a couple of times and they’ve been very nice about the false alarms.","Original review: Aug. 20, 2020"
"Lisa of Middletown, PA","My father was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease and he is on oxygen 24/7. Occasionally, his oxygen gets very low so we needed some kind of medical alert system to get help if needed. Two of our neighbors had such devices. One had Medical Guardian and the other had Life Alert. I researched them and I liked that Medical Guardian is in Pennsylvania which isn't far away. That made me feel better about them. We went with Medical Guardian and so far my father has used his badge a couple of times. He leaves the device on his headboard so he has something close to him while he's sleeping. He also wears the neckless device all the time and takes the portable unit when he goes far. We are happy with how fast somebody got to my father's location when he used the device.","Original review: Aug. 20, 2020"
"Jane of Maysville, OK",My mother-in-law wears her Medical Guardian all the time and she has fallen three different times since she's had it.

The bracelet keeps coming off and it keeps falling and keeps getting tangled, so it's not really good. I also don't like the light. It's way too bright. I used the device once. My husband fell, and I called the fire department. They responded, but they took a while. I know a person that was outside, he was the one that called the fire department, and they got the fire department here.

Supposedly, we should have it at all times. We've had to reset the device a couple of times because my husband brushed against it under his shirt. But other than that, everything is taken care of.

It really makes me feel good with my husband because he likes to be outside in the nice weather, putter, and walk around and he's very unstable.

I also feel very good about my sense of security since I got Medical Guardian. Before, I always walked around with my telephone with me. After it was laying there all night when I was in bed, I'd get up in the morning and it'd be beeping at me. So, thank goodness I don’t have to do that anymore.

I have it in such a way that I hope it makes it a bit stronger to keep around my neck here. I must have pulled on my lanyard and it pulled the clasp apart. The clasp is a magnet around the thing.

I wear the wristband mainly in the house. Most times during the day, I also put the GPS on 'cause I go out and I never know when I’m gonna go. It stays good within 300 feet of where the GPS is.

"Evelyn of Orlando, FL","I was looking online and Medical Guardian seemed like the easiest one to call. The other companies all seemed kind of confusing. Medical Guardian's website itself made it seem like it would be easier to get my dad set up. Before we knew he had COVID-19, he had been in the tub and was sitting there for seven hours because he didn't have enough strength to get up. My siblings thought he can't live by himself and if he's going to live by himself, he has to have something in case his phone's dead or he can't get out or can't get up to tell somebody. That's kinda why we decided to go with Medical Guardian. The process was pretty quick. I had asked for overnight shipping, so the device got here when they said it would. It was delivered early in the day. It didn't get delivered late in the evening which was what I was worried about the most. Everything, overall, was pretty good.","Original review: Aug. 7, 2020"

I don't like the dangling from my neck. I haven't had to use the device, but I do check once a month and every time, they've been right on cue. Having Medical Guardian makes a difference, especially like walking out in my yard where I'm afraid no one would notice. It allows me to do a lot of things I didn't use to feel safe doing.

The device is pretty simple. The only thing is, I didn't like their chain so I put a sterling silver on it. But it isn't working out well either because it gets very black and I'm not able to clean it that well. I wish there was something else I could wear around my neck. Also, others are much cheaper.

And I’m planning to touch base with them once a month and see if it’s still working.

"Nina of Cumberland, RI","I was in the hospital. I've been using my Medical Guardian device for a few days. I activated it and it's going well. I take it off when others sleep, but I put it on to go to the bathroom. Also, I like the blue light. It reminds me that it's there. It's simple to use. When I was moving it, I went over the button but the people over the thing said, “We just detected that you pushed the button. Did you push it? If you did, would you push it again?” I pushed it again because I hadn’t, but I realized how quickly they had responded.","Original review: Aug. 5, 2020"
"J. of Ma, MA","I wanted some kind of a device and Medical Guardian was recommended to me. I wear the button on my neck but I'd rather not have it. I also hope that I don't accidentally hit it and it goes off sometimes. But if I ever need it, I'll be glad to have it.","Original review: Aug. 5, 2020"
"Ellen of Greenville, DE","We got a Medical Guardian device for the confidence that if my mother-in-law fell, she could reach someone. Getting it set up was not expected to be super easy because it's not super easy, but it was easy for what it is. So far, so good. We got it to the length that she likes. You can adjust it and it has the tail down the back. We cut off the back tail and that solved it. My mother-in-law feels more secure having it as do we when we're not home with her. This is where we're still learning it but our understanding is that the communication with her is not through the device on her neck but through the box that’s in the home. My husband believed that you could only talk at the box. But the communication when she's talking to somebody is thru her button. The only downside is that when the phone doesn't work, it doesn't work either.","Original review: Aug. 5, 2020"
"Oleita of Darlington, MD","My daughter went on the computer and interviewed different people that sell these medical devices. She was trying to get something that would work the best for my husband and me and she found Medical Guardian. The only thing that bothers me about their device is that I hit the button when I lean over the washing machine to get my clothes out and they call me. I've done that twice. But they didn't wait to call me to see if I was okay, they called me right on the spot.","Original review: Aug. 4, 2020"
"Dawn of Sugarloaf, PA","When I first got my Medical Guardian, I tested the button to see if it works and they answered almost immediately. I just don't like the string around my neck. The device could have a softer string thing, but it's okay. Having it makes me feel secure. I'm very satisfied with my Medical Guardian.","Original review: Aug. 4, 2020"
"Doris of Whiting, NJ","Luckily, knock on wood, we haven't used the Medical Guardian device. My mother has been wearing it around her neck though it's not a favorite thing. The only thing is, and I guess it's ignorance on my part, I assumed she could talk into the thing that she's wearing and she would hear somebody talk. I didn't realize it's a base in the house and mom's hearing is not great. We even tested with her way up front, on the porch, like if she would’ve fallen on the porch. We tested having somebody call and she didn't hear it. The base is in the kitchen. But they said they will call her house phone if they get no response from the base. If they are calling a house phone, then that's fine. She's got one in the bedroom and another on the porch so she will obviously hear that. But she's scared that she's gonna hit something and someone's gonna be sending an ambulance and it's not needed.","Original review: Aug. 4, 2020"
"James of Columbus, GA","I tested the Medical Guardian device a couple of times. It says test once a month, so I do. When I punch it, it takes a good while before the operator comes on and says, “May I help you?” About a minute. I would like it not to wait so long. When the reps finally answer, they're very professional. They do good. I wore a necklace but they get tangled all up around my neck at nighttime. When I slip, and if something happened, I probably couldn't have found it. I switched over to the watch and I'm wearing it. I just got two concerns with it. If I had a stroke, I probably could never reach it to push the button. And if I had a heart attack and fell to the floor, I probably could never reach it. The only time that I could see that I could reach it is if I happened to fall and couldn't get up. If you can’t reach it and push the button, then what would it do?","Original review: Aug. 3, 2020"
"Virginia of Scio, OR",Everything went very well with Medical Guardian. The device has been comfortable to wear. I tested it when I first got it and the response was very good.

"Sylvia of Searcy, AR","I'm a widow and I live alone. There was a time when I fell and spent four hours on my kitchen floor. I broke a bone in my foot, seven ribs and totally destroyed my shoulder. I knew I was gonna spend the night on the floor if I didn't do something. I scooted over to my phone and called my daughter who then called the ambulance. It's been tough since then as I am still seeing physical therapists. I got a Medical Guardian and I wouldn't go out to my porch without it. I feel better with my neck device and it's very comfortable.","Original review: Aug. 3, 2020"

It's embarrassing to wear it in public. It flashes that light around the room at night. I may, in time, get used to it but I regret buying it. We've tested it once and they've read us loud and clear. It worked. However, I've fallen several times, and it's never detected it. I don't know how it's ever gonna help me.","Original review: Aug. 2, 2020"
"Samuel of Columbus, NJ","I am old, but I'm in good health. What got me going to get involved with the service is that I fainted some time ago. It woke me up and told me I could use something like that at that time. Now, I'm still indoctrinating myself into this program, but so far, it’s been working out fine for me. I'm doing very well and thank God I have not had to use the device.","Original review: Aug. 1, 2020"
"Teresa of Mesa, AZ","We were looking for a device for my mother to wear. My dad had passed away in June and she is firmly by herself during the day. We're working on changing that but we wanted her to have something. We tried another service and it wouldn't work in her home. They live in a manufactured home. So we went online and found Medical Guardian. We saw the ratings and they had good ones. This is the reason we made the decision. We called and verified that it would work in her home. So far, so good.","Original review: Aug. 1, 2020"
"T. of Fl, FL","Our resident wears her Medical Guardian pendant and it goes off at times and they contact us to go check on her. The service is very quick. It's within three minutes, normally, and it goes smoothly. Also, they're very professional. They even hold the line until we send someone to the room to check on the resident, which is not necessary, but they go the extra mile and say to hold on. It's very beneficial for our resident and for me. I’m the receptionist at the front desk, so I just radio the resident aide to go check on her. It’s a nice service.","Original review: July 8, 2020"
"Tomasz of Woodland Hills, CA","Okay, perhaps as far as handling medical emergencies the product might work just fine, but canceling this service has been an ongoing nightmare. About 6 months ago I ""cancelled"" this service. I got it for my 70 year old mother who doesn't really need it. It was a rash decision and she told me to just go ahead and cancel, so I did. Or at least I thought I did. After a month I got a warning that it hasn't been paid. I figured it must have been a mistake, then I was bombarded with emails and voice messages. Okay, something is wrong. I call them and they tell me that I need to return the equipment to properly close the account. I told them that I live on the other coast, and with covid 19 I don't want my elderly mother standing in the line at the post office. Is there a way around this. Nope. Okay, so what do I do? Keep paying.","Original review: July 6, 2020"
"Gavene of Robbinsville, NC","I fell and I couldn’t remember anything. I moved home by myself so my granddaughter got me a medical alert device I could wear and then I could call. I wear it all the time here at the house. I feel comfortable wearing it. All I have to do is tell them to call my son. And if I fall or lay here and I can’t get to the phone, it would call the ambulance by itself if I don’t answer so the ambulance would come first. I feel more at peace but I think my time is about up with them. It's got one of the lights off the machine.","Original review: July 2, 2020"

"Pamela of Harpers Ferry, WV","The Medical Guardian device was for my husband, and he has since passed away. Since I now live alone, I decided to keep it for myself to have something on hand just in case. It’s like a backup for me. I’m not having any health issues now, but it’s a comfort to me to not be alone here in the house at night. I have the device that’s plugged in here in the house. If I go somewhere, I can take that with me. I can take that with me in the car. I have the one thing that goes around my neck and the one that I could wear on my wrist which is the reason we got that it because we thought my husband might have rather had something that looked like a watch. Once we got it all set up, it was easy to set up to contact them. It had to ring a few times before they answered it, and I think it is because I’m out in the country. Our cell service is pretty good, but from time to time, there might be a glitch.","Original review: July 1, 2020"

Their ratings were high, and the woman that I spoke with, was unbelievable. And I like that it's not tied to a telephone.

We never used it. By the time we got our mother out of the hospital and the device made it to the house, she had passed away. I simply took it to the post office and returned it to sender.

"Gladis of Stephenville, TX","My niece bought a Medical Guardian device for me. It’s hanging around my neck. I’d had 25 falls in the yard and in the house, and any place I decide to turn around to the left, I was in danger of falling. I got a couple of really hard falls. The last one urged my niece to order the device. I have wooden floors over concrete, and I turned to the left after adjusting the television, and I hit the floor and banged up the whole right side of my face, head, shoulder and hip. I was paralyzed with pain for about a month. My niece decided it was time for a device that I could ring to get help in case I was here by myself when I fall and couldn’t get up. Ordinarily, I can manage to get up, or my grandson that lives with me comes and puts two hands under my armpits and hoists me to my feet. But I feel safe with my Medical Guardian device.","Original review: June 29, 2020"

It makes me feel better that I have it. It fastens with two magnets, and I wondered about why it wasn’t a clip. But it’s been comfortable. I’m not even aware that I’m wearing it. It just lays flat even at night in bed. People should get one, too.","Original review: June 29, 2020"

I called to say I didn't want that code because I've already given the code to my daughter, and I wanted a lockbox with the right code. The lady told me I could set it myself. I just had to go in and follow the directions. I didn't really wanna have to do that. I spent $500. Why is that my problem? I went in and read the directions. I played and played with it and thought the amount of money that I've paid for this quality service is ridiculous. It was uncalled for. It should have been, ""Yes, we made the mistake. We sent the wrong lockbox. We'll send you another one."" I called and got Jamal. He said I shouldn't have to do that so he sent me a new one with the right code.","Original review: June 27, 2020"
"Joan of Ashland, OR","My daughter ordered Medical Guardian for me. She checked all of them and decided that this was the best for me because I’m 90. This is also easier for her to check and get for me. It’s just a little bit uncomfortable on my wrist as I’m not used to wearing anything on it. It’s a little bit stiff and it kinda bothers me, but it’s fine. When I’m out on a farm and I do irrigation, I put on the one around my neck and I put it down in my blouse because of the leaning up and down with the irrigation. So, the one around the neck is comfortable although I don’t like to wear it in the house. I feel safer, that if I fall, I could push it. Hopefully it works ‘cause I haven’t used it.","Original review: June 27, 2020"

My two children and I researched online and then compared the medical alert devices when we got together on the weekend.

"S. of Fl, FL","Getting set up with Medical Guardian was fairly easy. I'm living alone and I thought I should have one. I'm also always pretty agile and athletic even though I live alone. I did research before I decided to purchase it and it was one of the devices that are available today for people who are active and want something that can go with them. I was wearing the watch because I'm very active and I want to be able to use it when I took my walks. The band on the watch device was uncomfortable, but I realize that you can get a different band on it. Medical Guardian is a good product, but I returned mine. I felt that I wasn't at the point in my life where I needed it. It was more of a burden for me to remember to put it on and have it with me.","Original review: June 19, 2020"

"Lucien of Portland, ME",I fell in my kitchen once and I really hurt my hip. I couldn’t get up. I had lost my mate to cancer a couple of months ago. I’m by myself with my cat and he can’t help me. So it took me a good half hour to finally get my composure and get myself up. But then I hurt for a week after. That incident told me it was time to get one of these devices and I talked to my mother. She’s a 90-year old person and she’s got a device too. So I asked her what I had to do to get one of these and I looked on the internet. I found out that Medical Guardian was the top shelf and I’m glad I got this. ,"Original review: June 18, 2020"
"Sue of Williamsburg, KY","My daughter got me a Medical Guardian device as she was concerned because I kept falling. I live by myself and I’m 83, and with it they feel like I was a little more protected. I’ve pushed the button accidentally three times. Once when I shut the tailgate of the truck and hit the monitor against it. And when they called me, of course, I wasn’t in the house and I don’t carry my cellphone, and they couldn’t get ahold of me. So, they called the kids. I don’t know what I could do. I don’t let the device hang loose. That’s uncomfortable if it’s hanging loose because I know I’m gonna hit it against something. But maybe if I had a little pocket that hangs with it that you could put it down in, that might be better because it gets a little hot with it on your naked skin and I don’t like that part.","Original review: June 18, 2020"
"Trisha of Dallas, TX","My mother is 92 and she lives with me. I still work and so does my husband. Medical Guardian had good reviews and I picked it out. We needed to put that there. With it, we feel somewhat secure. But we had a problem with the watch. My mom's very hard of hearing and she's blind in one eye. She set the watch off the first night she had it on. It was easy for her to do that as she was taking it off. We were asleep and the fire department came. That's why we got the pendant.","Original review: June 17, 2020"

"Bob of Evansville, IN","I bought the device for my mom in Indiana. She is 92 and she has had several falls. She also gets confused and has trouble getting up. We had gotten her a medical alert device last year and she refused to wear it but after her last fall, she said she wanted to try it again. So I got Medical Guardian. I had read some good reviews on it and it seemed to have the kind of coverage we wanted. I also ran it by my sister who is there helping my mom with it. I had a good experience ordering it. It was effortless and the device is working well now. My sister had everything set up and my mom already used it. She was getting out of bed and had trouble getting up one time. She pushed the button and the response was very good. At the time, we had just set it up so there weren't back-up numbers programmed in yet and they didn't have anybody to call. But they alerted the local service and they came and helped her out. It was very quick.","Original review: June 17, 2020"
"Denise of San Diego, CA","My doctor told me to get Medical Guardian and I like the watch that I'm wearing around my wrist. But I don’t like the pendant around my neck as it prevents me from sleeping. The watch is easier to wear and it’s not a nuisance. Other than that, having the device gives me a sense of safety and security. A couple times, I activated the device by accident because of the pendant. They immediately went on the speaker asking what was going on and if we needed help. We’re happy about that.","Original review: June 16, 2020"

It's nice that it tells you that, but I was surprise about how long the battery was. I have to charge it every day. My phone goes longer and that's what I was judging it on. So, I plug it in every night then. But other than that, I like it because there's one for my bathroom if something happened in the bathroom. I'm falling a lot. I live by myself. In the last month, I've had six really bad falls.","Original review: June 16, 2020"

Everybody was taking their turn with me. I was beginning to go, ""Guys. I can be alone."" They also got me a Medical Guardian. My son is a deputy fire chief here in San Antonio and he did some research. He decided that this was the one to go with. He ordered it and set it all up. It's very comfortable and I just know it's there. Even though I haven't used it, I trust that it's a good product. I would recommend it and if someone buys it for you, it's because they love you.","Original review: June 16, 2020"

"Sandra of Richmond, UT","My mother was home by herself, which was why we bought a Medical Guardian. The device's quality’s fine, but the wristband irritates her skin and she doesn’t wear that very often. Also, the necklace's string is too long. But if you use the device to shorten it, you get the big loop down the back. I'm trying to figure out how to pop that magnet out in the center and shorten that and still have the magnet back in there. Other than that, she likes the convenience of having it. It is waterproof and she can wear it throughout the house.","Original review: June 11, 2020"

I can hear it if I was anywhere in the house until the sound would carry back to the voice box. I’ve been pleased with it. The first thing I told him was that I was wearing it for the first time and that there was nothing wrong. He told me a couple of things about it. ","Original review: June 8, 2020"

I’m more at ease now because I know it’s just a hit of a button and I will have help. The reps were also great when I first got the device. I plugged it in and they came into it and tested it.

She couldn’t make up her mind whether she wanted the necklace or the bracelet. We paid for the year in advance and they said that they could mail me both out. But then when we received the product, it didn’t have the wrist device in it. But I called and the representative said that it had stated that the wristband would be sent as well, but it wasn’t.

"James of Central Point, OR","I had some falls and I was able to get up, but I figured I could have a bad one out in the yard and I wouldn't be able to get up. Having a medical alert device, I could get some help that way. Medical Guardian answered my questions and took care of me. I got the device I keep in the bathroom because that’s the place that quite often somebody falls and you can’t get the phone. I have it where I can reach it. Also, I usually put the device in my pocket when I go out in the yard or away from the house. Sometimes, I just carry my cellphone with me.","Original review: May 22, 2020"
"Mary of Chambersburg, PA","My neighbor has a Medical Guardian device and she talked me into it. I live in a retirement area and I feel very secure with it. I used it accidentally. I had it around my neck, bumped it to the washing machine, and it went off. It works. Response was right away. However, I put it through my clothes, and it hangs against my belly and it makes me cold. But I take it off at night and put it right the side of my bed on my nightstand. Also, my neighbor says she charges her device at night and it lasts about five days. Mine doesn’t, and maybe there’s something that should be checked. I also had called before because of the length of the chain that was sent to me. It's too long and I couldn’t adjust it. They sent me another one. This one is fine except that maybe there's any way I could have something that would not show at my neck. It’s just annoying. I’ve had neck surgery, and it pokes my neck. They have something for the wrist but it’s quite big and I don’t know if I want it.","Original review: May 22, 2020"
"L. of Tx, TX","We had a lot of inputs from various health people and we did a lot of research on our own. Medical Guardian seemed to be what would fit our needs the most. Their people did a good job of explaining things. I understood what we needed and what we got and all that. I test the button once a month and the response is excellent. We’re pleased with it so far. My husband doesn't wanna wear the pendant and the band but when I leave and I'm on a trip or gone for a night, he would wear them for my peace of mind. Everything has been okay.","Original review: May 21, 2020"
"Conchita of White Rock, BC","I wear my Medical Guardian device around the wrist because you never know, at 90 years old, you're going to fall. I live by myself, and my daughter lives in Phoenix, Arizona. So, she insisted I should have one of these. She's concerned because I'm by myself. I know a lot of people that have it on, and they're happy with it. I know if I need Medical Guardian, they'd be here.","Original review: May 21, 2020"
"Rose of Los Angeles, CA","My daughter got my Medical Guardian for me. It makes me feel safer 'cause I'm alone.

"Susan of Lewiston, ID","I have neuropathy in my feet, so I cannot feel very well on how I am walking. I also have a bad back hips, bad knees, and I lose my balance, which cause me to fall. For the peace of mind for my son, he tried to get me signed up on something. Then, I smartened up and went online, finding out that Life Alert was a bad one and that the best one was Medical Guardian. My first interaction with this company was great. There was no high-pressure with them like that of the Life Alert people. I, however, need another pamphlet on how to turn it on because I have not done that yet. I also would like to get another string for the necklace part because my cat bit through the little string that goes on the neck. The bracelet part also chafed my arm, so I took it off because it feels like it is cutting like a cutter.","Original review: May 20, 2020"
"Norma of Phoenix, AZ","I had been in the hospital for several months. I'm 89 years old and living alone. We felt a medical alert system was the best insurance I could have if I did fall. A good friend of mine uses the Medical Guardian service and was so pleased. I went on the internet and they responded quite fast. I tested the device when it was first installed and the response I got was wonderful. They were very prompt, thorough, and reassuring. With my Medical Guardian, I know that I have help at my fingertips or at my wrist should something happen. So far, I haven’t had to use it so everything is fine. And I hope I don’t have the opportunity to use you. But it is a very comforting and reassuring thing to know I have help that’s readily available. I also just recommended Medical Guardian to a neighbor of my daughter who’s using it and she’s very pleased.","Original review: May 20, 2020"
"Linda of Houston, TX","I was concerned about her falling or being alone most of the day, so I got something she could immediately get assistance from if she needed help. I looked at customer reviews of one of Medical Guardian's competitors. I liked the fact that with Medical Guardian you can press the button and you can actually talk to somebody immediately that monitors the system versus just having medical emergency personnel come out when it was an accident. What Medical Guardian will do is they’ll contact the family. There are several family contacts that they have listed, but they can reach one of us if it's something that definitely requires necessarily an ambulance.","Original review: May 20, 2020"
"Deborah of Cypress, TX","My mom was moving in with us and I was looking for some extra security. I searched online and found Medical Guardian.

It's working well.","Original review: May 19, 2020"
"Ann of Franklin, NJ","My daughter got my Medical Guardian device for me. I’ve only had it for just two months now. A couple of times, I banged it on something. I was cooking, and when I moved across the counter, it hit the counter and it beeped, and it came right on and the responder said, “Is everything is okay?” They’re very good and very pleasant people. They said, “Okay, we’ll reset it. Don’t you worry. We’re here for you anytime you need us.” Also, I fell three different times and at one time, I could not get up and I laid on the floor for almost an hour trying to figure out a way to get myself back up again. And then, twice I fell trying to get out of the tub because I wasn’t balanced properly. I told them that and they said, “Oh, sure. Anytime you have any trouble at all, you call us. That’s what we’re here for.” I feel very safe with it. I’m so happy I have it now. I like Medical Guardian very much.","Original review: May 19, 2020"
"Natalie of El Cajon, CA","I ordered and installed a Medical Guardian device for my brother-in-law. I made my choice for it after reviewing 10 other ones. I felt that the whole package of product was more comprehensive and you didn't have to go buy something at the store to make up the difference that wasn't provided. Once I made my choice based what was available in the plan that I chose, it worked out much better for me. It was also simpler for me and the person that helped me was outstanding. He was so helpful, too. The total experience was very positive and when I ordered and worked with the representatives, they were very helpful. And the equipment was simple and straightforward. So far, it’s working properly, so everything is great. Plus, I've done tests with it where I've talked to the people that responded and they were very quick and efficient.","Original review: May 19, 2020"
"Sally of Springfield, OR","I was in the hospital for about a month and a half, and I live by myself. When I got out of the hospital, my son had the Medical Guardian device hooked around me. He paid for it for years. The first time we tested the device, my son told me I had to do it at the first of the month. Medical Guardian said, “Okay, no problem then. You don't need any help?” And I said no. Then, by my chair at home, there was a bracelet there with a black band. I thought it was my watch that I had left out there. I pushed that button to see why my watch wasn’t showing anything, and they came on. I said, “Sorry, I just made a mistake.” They were very patient with me.","Original review: May 19, 2020"
"Patricia of Lovettsville, VA",My son did a lot of research and decided that Medical Guardian was the one he wanted to get for me. I'm wearing it on my wrist because I like to hang my glasses around my neck. It's a little uncomfortable when I'm trying on clothes. It's leather and it's not that easy to hook up. But I would rather do that than have to wear it around my neck. My neck would be overloaded. And it suits me fine to have it on my wrist. Medical Guardian has done everything they promised they were gonna do. One thing though is that my son paid initially for the package and I was gonna be paying the monthly bills but I haven't seen any and I'm wondering what's going on with my account.,"Original review: May 18, 2020"
"Anita of Seabrook, TX",My daughter got Medical Guardian set up for me and I got it. I tested the device this month and the response was rather quick. I explained to the rep that I was fine and that I didn't need any help. They didn't need to send anybody because I was just testing the device. The rep said okay. I was told I have to test it every month to make sure it’s working. ,"Original review: May 18, 2020"
"Rodney of Columbus, MS","I looked on the internet and compared Medical Guardian against others, and got them based on my reviews. If I am away and my mother is incapacitated or can’t get up, she can at least push her buttons and get some assistance. I have tested the device several times. The reps have been very good. The only thing is even though I have good cell coverage here at my mother’s house, the base unit goes in and out on cell coverage. It’ll lose its coverage and then it’ll come back. It does that periodically throughout the day.","Original review: May 18, 2020"
"George of Hawthorne, NJ","I fell and nobody else was around. I pushed the Medical Guardian button and then I had to wait. I had to switch the call. With the protocol, it used to go to the kids first and if they weren’t around, it would go to the police. But I wanted it to go to the police right away because they always came fast with no problems. My daughter changed the protocol and the call goes right to the police headquarters. The cops have come two or three times. I had to wait a little, but it wasn’t too bad. The first time was really fast. I'd recommend it.","Original review: May 17, 2020"

I had a Medical Guardian device a long time ago for my wife, and I decided maybe it was time that I get one. The last time I fell, I had to have help to get up and there were people here that day to help me. But if there hadn't been, I would be laying in the closet because that's where I fell in. I feel more comfortable having the device around and when I'm by myself, but I could get help if I did fall again.","Original review: May 17, 2020"
"Bonnie of Sacramento, CA","My brother seemed pretty impressed with Medical Guardian's record and we bought a medical alert device from them. It's for my father and we got it because he had fallen a couple times, and he has difficulty getting himself back up. He is in his late 80s and his health is not the greatest. So, we wanted something to where he could have immediate access to help and not have to rely on finding a cellphone. Every time I go over there, he’s wearing it and he makes sure it’s charged. So, it seems to be working really well for him. Other than that, Medical Guardian suggested that you could call when you’re first activating it and I was very impressed when I did. I got a person who talked to me and explained how things work and what to do.","Original review: May 17, 2020"

I don’t use it much. But everything is all right with my Medical Guardian. It’s okay. When I originally did it, if I signed up for a year, I would get a one-month discount. Then the woman I talked to said, “it’ll cost this much.” I paid upfront for a year but I never got that discount. So, I almost sent it back because of that, but I didn’t. When I know I’m gonna be around the house here and especially if I’m gonna be out in the yard trying to do something, I put it on. For what it’s advertised to do, it’s fine.","Original review: May 16, 2020"

I'm happy with my device. But there was a problem with the water filter. There's a water filter on the faucet and when I touched that, it set off the alarm three times. The last time it happened, I told Medical Guardian what was happening and they said to turn the device backwards when I am at the sink. I've done that and it didn't go off. The device also went off because I was trying to open a jar and I pulled that jar close to my torso and it set it off.","Original review: May 16, 2020"

"Alexandra of Galloway, NJ","My husband was hospitalized for 17 days. When he came out of the hospital, he was not able to walk very well anymore so he was a severe fall risk. It was very important for us to have the device because I had to work. At that time, I was away from home. Even though I work part-time, we still needed it. It gave me a sense of security knowing that he was able to call for help when I was gone. I made sure he always had his bracelet on. It doesn’t seem to bother him unless he had it on too long like overnight, or if he forgot to take it off and then it could get a little itchy under there. But most of the time, we just put it on when I leave the house. He had to use it a couple times when he fell so it does what it says it’s going to do, and it has been very reliable.","Original review: May 15, 2020"

They usually respond pretty quickly. If I hit the button right here with the little light blinking on and off, their response is pretty good.

"Kay of Centreville, AL","I live on the campus of a hospital. It has quite a few apartments for elderly people. The first couple of devices that I used came from the hospital and I liked the way they worked, but they were so heavy. I felt like I had a big rock around my neck all the time. I find myself hanging it on the back of a chair just so I wouldn’t have that weight around my neck. They worked well but I was looking for something that was much lighter. Also, one of the devices I previously had would go off for no reason at 2 in the morning. I didn't even have it around my neck. I told them but it didn't get fixed and that was another reason I wanted to change. One of my daughters found Medical Guardian and so far, everything is fine. The last time I checked it, the response was quick. I stay with it on.

Once or twice when I started, I was in contact with them and their response time was very good. But I don’t like the idea that I always have to carry with me the remote thing. The one I had before was on a necklace and I just had to wear that one item. With the Medical Guardian, I have to actually carry the remote speaker with me anywhere I go. That could be improved. It’s a simple thing and other companies do it. Besides that, everything is working fine.","Original review: May 14, 2020"

They got one that was just for the home and there was a 600 feet out from where the box is and then they got one for people that drive away from home. The watch came off while I was sleeping. I got the watch laying here on the table and I got the other thing around my neck. I have a broken hip and when I move around, the necklace keeps coming undone where I wear it under my t-shirt. The little magnets come undone and it falls down. Then when the electric goes off, this goes off too, and it blinks.","Original review: May 13, 2020"

But the few times I tested it, they were right there. I have both the wrist device and the necklace. I wear the wrist one all the time and there is no problem whatsoever. I love it.

We test the device each month and when we press the button, the dial takes a little while. Sometimes, it'll connect immediately and other times, it would take about 40 seconds up to a minute. Also, it would nice if the wristband for the button had something my grandmother can talk through so if Medical Guardian's team can't hear her, they can automatically call. Still, the response we get is pretty good. It's also convenient for my grandmother that the device is simple and waterproof.","Original review: May 13, 2020"

I was at Camp Brown again a week ago, and I got no signal on my Guardian at all where I could call out. I finally got somebody and they said everything was working then I did it fine at home. Also, when I first got it, I accidentally pushed the button. I also pushed the button for a test, and they responded quickly. I was surprised.","Original review: May 10, 2020"
"William of Starke, FL","My Medical Guardian worked perfectly the times that I needed to use it. So far, so good. I went down in my bedroom trying to pick up a laundry basket. I fell and had insufficient leg strength to get back up off the floor. I used my device to summon a paramedic and they arrived in five minutes and helped me back up to my feet. The Medical Guardian reps were very pleasant and they seemed to be a nice group of people. The device helps me feel more secure. But it would be nice if they could lower their rental rate a little bit.","Original review: May 10, 2020"
"J. of Ca, CA","Fortunately, we haven’t had use for our Medical Guardian device, which is good news. My husband tested it at the beginning when it first was delivered.

When my husband had to run errands and I am alone, which is not often, I put it on my neck.","Original review: May 10, 2020"
"S. of Pa, PA","I had a fall in December and broke my hip, and my kids thought we should have a medical alert device.

"Rita of Bronx, NY","I stopped wearing a medical alert device because I purchased an Apple Watch but I realized I still needed it, so I went back to it. I had a bad experience with a company I previously had when I needed an ambulance and they took a very long time. And with another company, the pendant itself was a piece of junk. It kept falling apart. So I went to Medical Guardian. I wish that the pendant was smaller. It’s very clunky. But I've used it and the response time was excellent. Somebody stayed on the phone with me the whole time waiting for the ambulance to come, which I thought was great.","Original review: May 10, 2020"

I bumped my button a couple of times and it came off. They were immediately right there.","Original review: May 9, 2020"

The response was very quick and to the point. I wear the device around my neck. I wear it to bed too because I get up at night to go to the bathroom, but I worry about rolling over and setting it off. Overall, having it is like an insurance.","Original review: May 9, 2020"
"Giovanna of Queens, NY","I had a hip replacement and it popped out twice. Fortunately on both times, somebody was home with me. But the fear was that if I was by myself, how quickly could I get somebody to help me. My daughter looked up alert online and Medical Guardian came up. The device has been very helpful. I haven’t needed it at all but it's just the peace of mind knowing that I have it. Usually, I put it on every day. But sometimes when I'm out walking to the door to get something random by myself, I would realize I forgot to put it on. Medical Guardian is great. I put it in inside my blouse so nobody sees it. It's not the most secretive piece but it's not meant to be. For what it is, it's perfect.","Original review: May 9, 2020"

But then, back in November, I had an accidental freak fall in the living room and broke my left femur and left wrist. So, that laid me out for a while. I thought, maybe it's time. I'm wearing the watch, I'm thinking I may go to the necklace. And I wonder if I can just switch back and forth 'cause the back of it irritates the skin on my wrist. It's kinda rough. I move it up and down, but it's still irritating where it gets hot.","Original review: May 9, 2020"
"Geraldine of Green Bay, WI","I was concerned that I was very forgetful and my family was concerned about me. Having Medical Guardian makes my family feel better. The other night, I woke up and could hear voices in the living room. I wondered what was talking and then I realized that the unit was trying to talk to me. I had been sleeping, so I might have laid on it. Yesterday, I pushed the button because I got mixed up and I caused a small fire in my stove. There were firemen in the house and the fire was taken care of. I'm satisfied with my Medical Guardian experience.","Original review: May 9, 2020"
"Susan of Pine Beach, NJ","When I googled the devices, I saw that one had a better rate. I called and I liked what they had to say. So that's the one I went with. We were given both the wrist band and the necklace. He chose the wristband and it was easy to use the device and set up everything. You had to follow the directions which were very user-friendly. The only issue that we have is that we have a two-story house and the bedrooms are upstairs. I moved the box that would be alerted if there was an emergency to a center hall table. But even with that, if my husband fell upstairs, he'd have to yell pretty loudly and if he's knocked unconscious, obviously he can't. But Medical Guardian assured me that they would call out twice and if they would not get a response, they would automatically send the police, the fire truck and the ambulance – the whole gang would apparently come.","Original review: May 9, 2020"

When I got back home, my kids were trying to figure out what I should do because I don’t have anyone who lives in the house with me outside of my cat and he’s no rescue thing. Towards the end of January, they had me get a Medical Guardian ordered. At first, I was good about always taking the thing with me and wearing it on my wrist then I got out of the habit of doing that. I fell again here on Friday of last week and I scraped my face and my hand.","Original review: May 8, 2020"

"Pat of Bradley, CA","My daughter decided I get the device. I suffered a blackout and it happened as I was walking through the door from the garage to the kitchen. And when I collapsed, I hit my head on the top of a tile countertop. That was a year ago and I still am not completely recovered. I'm dizzy. I cannot get up and down the stairs without assistance. I suffered a subdural hematoma. It's one of those crazy accidents that only happen once in a million times that you've gone to a doorway. We tested the device around the 1st of the month. My daughter checks it when she comes out. She comes out every three to four weeks. She's an RN so she's aware of all of these things and she said, ""Okay, works just fine.""","Original review: May 8, 2020"
"Martha of Jenison, MI","My daughter is in the medical field and she said that purchasing a medical device would be good. We got the Medical Guardian. My husband has one as well, so we both wear one and keep it at our bedside at night. Two days ago, I was working in the kitchen and I leaned against the lower cabinet from the top, and it accidentally went off. I had a call within 30 seconds, so it was perfect. My phone rang and I answered it and explained to him there was no problem but I was sorry I accidentally did that. So, I’m more careful now that I don’t lean against it quite so easily. The device is fine. I have no problem with it, my husband either. We barely feel it that it’s on. It’s very light. So, we’re very pleased with us having them on, seeing we’re both in our 80s. It gives some comfort.","Original review: May 8, 2020"

So a lot of times, I just do stuff. I figured if I fall, then all I have to do is press that button. It makes me feel more comfortable because I have it on my wrist and it's got a button on it. I have no problems wearing it and I wear it everyday. I take it off when I go to bed and when I get up in the morning, I put it on. I like wearing it and I'm happy with it.

I have the thing around my neck right now and keep it on. At night, I hang it on my walker, and it hangs down long enough so that if I fall onto the floor, I can reach it from the floor. Wearing it is not bothersome at all, and I do not even notice I have it on. If I ever use it and they call me, I'd have them call my son to come help get me up -- I wouldn’t want someone coming to get me up from far away.

I had just come out of a major surgery and my husband was trying to talk to the people and tell them what to do. His name and his phone number were on the list but they did not wanna talk to him. They didn’t wanna do what he said. He had to hand me the phone to get them to do what they needed to do. I said that I didn't understand why they were having problems talking to my husband.

But the necklace is bad around my neck and it bothers me. So, I wear the wrist kind and it is easy to wear. But I'm always afraid that the band is going to come off because the little loops that hold the band when you put it on move around. It needs to be a little firmer or a little sturdier material. It’d also be nice if the GPS was in the actual device you’re wearing as right now, I have to carry the GPS with me.

I did it faster than I thought I would do it, but it's a step into your very definite old age that you have to acknowledge. I chose the Active Guardian because I thought that if I'm going to get one, the Active one with the GPS is better. This device would be of help if I had to use it.

She made sure I have all my bracelet before I go out, and I feel okay most of the time since this was going on. I don't pay any mind about wearing it. I have the neck one, but I don't want to sleep with it because I might choke myself. I put on the one that is made like a watch when I go out. Overall, I'm satisfied with it.","Original review: May 2, 2020"
"Nancy of Chandler, AZ","I’m going to be 77 years old and I’ve had two hip replacements. I’ve had some problems as well. If I needed help, then it would be something I could get immediately with a medical alert device. When I was looking online, I wanted what the consumers felt was the best one, and that’s what I found with Medical Guardian. It had the highest rating, so I picked them and some of the main things are that it’s very easy to use, and they can talk to you. It’s heavy though. I stick it in my bra so it doesn’t hang down.","Original review: May 2, 2020"
"M. of Ca, CA","I did some research online, and I liked what Medical Guardian was offering (the pricing and the options) better. It fit our needs and everybody was helpful. They were great.

Soon after she received it though, everybody got sent home and she was no longer alone in the house.","Original review: May 1, 2020"
"Donna of Sebring, FL","My husband falls a lot, and I was in and out of the hospital a lot. So, that was why our son bought the device. He was worried. I was in the hospital an awful lot last year, so our son didn’t like his father being home alone. We have accidentally nudged it twice already and the reps responded immediately, which was fine. Medical Guardian worked when I accidentally pushed it on.","Original review: May 1, 2020"

I couldn’t get an office, and there was no number either. Anybody I spoke to kept telling me Monday they’ll be in and they couldn't help me, so I switched. My assistant got me settled with Medical Guardian and the device was too sensitive for me. It went off three times in a month, but none of those that I needed them. One time, I was just getting dressed, and another time, I was breathing heavy. One night, I found the fire department in my bedroom. They tried to call me to see if there was anything wrong, but I didn’t hear it, so they sent somebody out. So far, I’m okay. I got another device and I thought I would find it heavy, but I don’t find it heavy.","Original review: April 30, 2020"

"Art of Gig Harbor, WA","The only problem that I had with Medical Guardian was in the testing. I found that I had to hold the button down for 10 seconds to get a response. Also, they sent a form out that required to be filled out, which I did and sent back. A few weeks later, they said I didn’t send it back. I took a partial photostat of the one that I had sent them and sent that back to them. A couple of weeks later, they said I didn’t send anything back. I finally said I would quit messing around with it and filled the thing again and mailed it back. It’s okay now.","Original review: April 29, 2020"

When I called Medical Guardian to check on their product, the gentleman that I spoke to gave me all the information I needed to know. He was very helpful and he said the right things. I got it right then and I didn't check anybody else. But I only wanted the device for three months, so I'm gonna send it back. My husband is doing better now and he says he doesn’t need it.

And so far, I'm very pleased with the device. I put the button around my neck and stick it in my pocket.

I thought it would be a better thing for me to get a medical alert device because I was at home by myself. I wanted it in case of an emergency, I would have a way to call someone. Everybody at Medical Guardian was always friendly to me. Their rep made sure my device was hooked up right and they tested it and everything. It was a very simple interaction and I liked that about it. They just said to push the button, hold it, and release it. And then, they'd see and call me back.","Original review: April 28, 2020"

I had knee surgery last October too and I just wanna make sure in case I make a tumble. Outside of that, it’s worked well for me.

But the ambulance got to the house before he got back from the front gate, so they broke down my back door to get in. It was quite the thing, which I don't remember any of.

I did my research and I went through all the medical alert brands. There was a website where they gave a rating for each one and Medical Guardian was one of the top-rated ones. They had good ratings with their response times and people seem to be very satisfied with the coverage. So, I thought I would try. Price-wise, it was a little bit higher than some of the rest, but then, the other brands had contracts. It was a plus with the no contract.

After deducting a ridiculous amount for restocking and other charges they credited a big $70. I instructed the company to mail me a check as the executor of my sister's estate. Instead they credited a charge card that can no longer be accessed. After assuring me they would make good, they decided it was not worth their reputation to do so. So I guess for a lousy few dollars they are willing to have people like me write these negative reviews. Shame on them and their terrible business practices.","Original review: March 20, 2020"

Pushed the alert button & they couldn’t hear me but I could hear them...Finally he heard me & I told him we were experiencing problems with the device & he said “call Customer service tomorrow, they’re closed today.” Are you kidding me?

I returned everything on December 16 by FEDEX and Medical Guardian received the equipment from me on December 19 and it was signed as received. Well, my credit card is still being charged every month until today March 2020. No matter how many phone calls to Medical Guardian I do and how many disputes I have to go through every month with my credit card company, they continue charging my credit card.

They stated that ATT is crappy service (being their excuse to get out of whatever onus they have on protecting my father with this medical device). They constantly take our payment monthly of 44.95, yet say that the ATT service is bad (so why did they sell us this service). We've had it about a year and are finally ending the service.

I purchased the watch without the frills as my mother is 81 and a non-sophisticated user.

I checked my device on purpose to make sure it was working, and it went okay. I turned it off really quickly because they were gonna send somebody out here, and I didn't need anybody. My device is okay. I feel naked if I don't have it on. When I take a shower, I take it off. And I put it back on as soon as I get out of the shower. I have a handicapped shower. They say you could get it wet, but I’m afraid I’d get it too wet. I'm satisfied with it.","Original review: Aug. 22, 2019"
"Johanna of Worcester, MA","This watch, a mobile unit, uses AT&T cellular service to dial out to the Mobile Guardian Call Center, and to receive voice calls and messages. The watch, which loses its charge quickly, must be charged at 100% with a strong cell service to work. No or low AT&T service at peak times in my area, because Verizon owns all the towers where I live, and no connection to the Call Center at any time. Know that the watch face is about 2x2.5 inches square and about .5 inches thick. It is suitable for a large wrist, but sits heavily and awkwardly on a small woman's wrist. The watch does not include a fall detection service either, so if you trip and fall, and hit your head, you are out of luck.","Original review: Aug. 21, 2019"

I’ve already told my sister-in-law about Medical Guardian. She falls a lot so she needs one. I think they got it through her insurance.

So he needs something that would get somebody over there to help him get up. We set up the device from Medical Guardian to where if he pushes the button, they ask him if it’s an emergency and he just tells them to call me, the hospital or an ambulance, or he gives them a directive as to what to do. So far, he used it five times and if he would call the ambulance, it would be there within 10 minutes. If he'd call me, it'd take 30 minutes because I’m on the other side of town from him. But if he was not hurt, he would rather me come and help him than go to the hospital.","Original review: Aug. 11, 2019"

I also have health problems and COPD that’s why I wanted to deal with Medical Guardian. I only had to use it once since having it. I couldn’t breathe and I was really ill.

I was sick and I forgot to get rid of it so now, I'm stuck for another year but I'm going to get rid of them in December. I got the Premium medical alert from Medical Guardian.

Recently, however, the pendant fell off the cord and, after trying a few times, my mother couldn't get it back on. I spoke to Customer Service by chat (the rep was Princess) and was told that I needed to add the $5.99 a month insurance or pay $50 for a replacement (I was unaware of this fee). That was it. Period. No exceptions; no first time replacement free; no help at all. I was very unhappy to be penalized for the lack of durability in their equipment.","Original review: July 29, 2019"
"Betsy of Palm Springs, CA","We purchased the Freedom Guardian for my step-father, who is 82 years old, and the medical alert system seems to be working well. The watch does not provide accurate current weather or forecasting information, however. We live in the SW desert and the watch currently claims the temperature is 85F whereas it is in fact 105F! We spoke extensively with the customer care operator and also with his supervisor about this problem. Both said that the weather feature is not really an important feature. They were neither able to resolve the problem nor were they willing to exchange the watch for one with a working weather feature. My step-father decided to keep the watch, but we are nonetheless disappointed. It makes him less eager to wear the watch, which is indeed a shame.","Original review: July 4, 2019"

"Sandy of Bakersfield, CA","I'm 78 years old and I have some problem falling. And once I fall, I can't get back up. I have a hard time because I have metal in both of my knees. I fell on the floor and I needed the Medical Guardian team to come out. The response time was great. They got through the window and helped me get up. That was all I needed. But they were really nice. I have the device on my neck, and I have one for my wrist. I change it off every once in a while. The band on the wrist could have a material that I would like better. The rubber sticks on my arm and causes rash. Other than that, they're doing excellent. But I think they could make it more reasonable for elderly people.","Original review: May 7, 2019"

"Pam of Spokane, WA","We used the information in the Consumer Affairs summary about fall alert devices to make our choice of the Medical Guardian. This has been a great choice! It was extremely easy to set up and use. It works through the phone company, so mom is not tied to a ""base station"" and can walk anywhere. It has an accelerometer so it will detect a fall if she cannot press the button. It has ONE nice big button (essential because she is almost blind) and a LOUD speaker on the device (she is also nearly deaf). Staff were very helpful at set-up, which itself was simple. And we've already had occasion to use the alert when mom was unwell. There were cheaper units on the market but this one does so much to assure our peace of mind and give her flexibility and independence. I'd recommend it to anyone.","Original review: April 29, 2019"

I like wearing it around my neck, but I don't wear it uptown because it only works up to my mailbox. But that's alright. There's always somebody with you if you need help, like in church or when I go to the store I got people around me. A couple of times I’ve touched it and I had to tell her I just bumped it a little bit and it would go off, but I never really had to use it for emergency yet.

At about the same time, this Medical Guardian came in through the mail and I love it. It has a range of 600 feet so I just use it around the house. But when I’m home is when I need it anyway because I’m alone. In fact, it has come in useful for me twice. When I called them, they sent an ambulance out immediately. I don’t think I was alone for more than five minutes. It saved my life. I used it for the second time recently. I kept falling and passing out so they came and got me through the Medical Guardian. It gives me a lot of feelings of security and I would recommend it.

I paid $290 something for a year when I got it. the device goes around my neck. It has white on it and I have the bracelet to go with it. Then when I fell out here in the yard, the device went off.

And then, the Medical Guardian team came on there to let us know that it was disconnected. So, it’s really alert, and it really picks up everything. If I happen to press the thing on my neck accidentally, it picks it up right away.

Medical Guardian called me at 6am on the weekend to inform me that my mom device was registering a fall signal. I said, well where is she? They did not know, what kind of service had I purchased that could not determine her location. I personally had to go and find her. They never sent help to her location, and did not call me back. I had to call them and let them know she was ok. I feel this company owes me a refund, after all I did their work for them. I will never use Medical Guardian. I make it know the experience with this company when meeting with the elderly in my community and church.

I have a disability of muscular dystrophy and my husband has a mother who's 95 up in Massachusetts so there are times when I'm alone. I also needed the device for when I'm driving in the car. I had to have a chairlift put in and the man who did the installation recommended Medical Guardian. I got the mobile one that you can take. It has a GPS in it so that if I’m in the car, the Medical Guardian team would know exactly where I am. That was one of the reasons I really thought it was a good idea and so far, the experience has been great. The installation and their availability for being in touch have been fine.

I've tested the device, but not as often as I should. The last time that I tested it, it rang quite a few times before anyone from the Medical Guardian team picked up. But when they did, they were friendly and able to answer my questions.","Original review: March 29, 2019"

I wound up with a Medical Guardian after my daughter went on a website and looked at all of the medical alert devices. Now, I have the model that goes around my neck. However, when I take a shower or go to bed, I put it on my walker because I can't stand the device on my neck at night when I'm sleeping. Also, I have to charge the device so often. Every two or three days, I'm already charging it. Nevertheless, wearing the device has been very comfortable.","Original review: March 26, 2019"

I have them strategically placed in the house where I can get to them if I'd have to crawl. Having them has greatly increased my sense of security. I know now that if I fall and I can't get up, then I have a way to contact someone. I check the device every now and then and it works.

But if something happens and you can’t get close to your monitor, then you could have 10 policemen outside your door or whatever else they decide to send, when maybe all you need is some help getting up. I have an upstairs and a downstairs, which is why my kids wanted me to get this thing – in case I fall. But women don’t always have pockets in their clothes so I asked if I could have one of those monitors for downstairs. However, I was told I could not, unless I would pay another 500 bucks. That is a lot of money and their service stinks. ","Original review: March 23, 2019"

Still, I’m afraid of pushing the button accidentally which I have already done. Maybe they could make it into a decoration or a brooch instead of a necklace. Other than that, the Medical Guardian people have been great. They are so gentle and kindly mannered. Even when I accidentally pushed the button and didn’t really need them, they were right there quickly. Now, I’m a lot more careful and I’ve slowed down a little bit more.

The first time my father-in-law had to use the device, the company sent the equipment to the wrong address. It was a comedy of errors.

I didn’t understand why they couldn’t suspend the service and give a window to return the equipment. The representative said, ""We don’t even know if your mother is deceased."" REALLY?!?!

"Debora of Madison, WI","Loved the idea and were willing to pay the higher monthly cost to have a 'smart watch' where we could communicate with mom. Everything and everyone was wonderful for 2 days. 1) Watch battery that was supposed to last 48 hours didn't last even 12, powered off at 30 % because we used the watch feature (time) 2 or 3 times throughout the day. We were told because we had 4G Att service (they never asked) and the watch only used 3G. 2) We were sent a watched that had been used before by someone before (we discovered this by looking at the call log when we signed up for the care team).

For the one that’s around the neck, I’m gonna have to go get a silver chain and put it on because the ugly black rope it’s on is awful. I don’t like any of their products.

However, I wasn’t sure my Medical Guardian device was working right the first time I tested it. With the first device I had, the other agency would respond as soon as I pressed it. The Medical Guardian device, on the other hand, takes a little bit of time. I thought that maybe it was not going through and I would think that I might get panicky if I really had something going on and I was waiting for somebody to answer. Still, the team answered, took care of anything, and they were fine.

But I ain’t paying the money that they want if they’re not gonna perform and help me feel satisfied that I wouldn’t have to be here 24/7. That's why we changed over to Medical Guardian.

"Winifred of Salem, OR","I fell down out in my garden. I have arthritis and I couldn’t get up. I went to the doctor and he recommended some therapy. The doctor also had someone come to the house and those two people that came were excellent. Their attitude and patience in showing me how to use the Medical Guardian device impressed me. I don’t like the rope on the necklace thing. It's so long but it’s okay. When the device went off accidentally the response time was so quick. It gives me some security knowing that if you’re alone and you fall, someone’s there.","Original review: Jan. 30, 2019"

From the hospital, they sent me to a rehab center and I was losing my balance. So my son gave me one of those medical alert devices. He was very worried about what happened to me because that had never happened to me. They had never seen me in the hospital before. That made him so scared.","Original review: Jan. 29, 2019"

My only concern is that the apparatus where I would have to speak into is located in a different room from my bedroom. So, I don’t think I would be able to get to speak into the machine if there was something happening.

I had to press it several times and it squealed really loud, and it didn’t seem like it was working. Other than that, the representatives from Medical Guardian have been fine. One time, I got my device on my belt and I dropped my pants too fast that it sounded like there was a fall. They reached out and I told them, “No, it wasn’t that. I had dropped my pants too quick.” The rep said okay and asked if everything was okay. That was a good response.","Original review: Jan. 14, 2019"

My neighbor called me and said they were trying to get in touch with me as the device had gone off. So, I tried to call Medical Guardian but the ambulance came out here already.

My sister-in-law in Santa Maria had Medical Guardian, and we had been talking to her about it. But for one reason or another, we had not gotten around to it. We were just putting it off because other things were happening. But my daughter, while I was in the hospital, ordered my Medical Guardian device.

I don’t use the necklace at all because I don’t like the band that’s around it, so I just have it on my wrist. But when I go out, I don’t take it with me because if I push the button, it’s gonna contact the base at home, or the telephone would call but I’m not there. So, it does me no good away from my home, or if I fall. I’m 81 going on 82, and all that could happen. Even if I take the base to California, where I go every other month, it’s not gonna work there any differently. I'm very dissatisfied. It's not that they're not a good company, but I don’t think it meets the needs.

Since then, I absolutely feel like there's somebody there if I need them. I accidentally set off the device several times, and the response I got was good.

"Teresa of Crocker, MO","I have a form of diabetes known as LADA. It's very severe and classified as 1.5. With its price, Medical Guardian seems like a very good deal. However, it doesn't offer some of the things that I personally would prefer that it did. I haven't had to actually use it because with my LADA, I also have what is called ""hypoglycemia unawareness"". I'm incapable of punching buttons when I'm passed out so nothing does me any good unless it calls for help when I pass out. Other than that, I've actually found that it gives a sense of comfort because I know that should I need any help, they're gonna be alerted when I hit the button. At the back of my mind, I can use the device to talk to people and ask for an officer or a fireman. Should I pass out in public, people can push the button and summon a paramedic without having to find their own cellphones. Obviously, it's not the solution to my problems, but it helps because it gives me that little extra edge of security in the long run.","Original review: Jan. 5, 2019"

We were very happy to have Medical Guardian at that time. I was about 10 minutes away from my apartment when the phone rang. It was some guy telling me that I better get home. My wife had fallen down in the bathroom. I was there within nine minutes and we got her up and about. That worked out fine.

Of course I called and noted my emails, calls, etc. They truly don't care and just want to charge for more service and cheap equipment. I cannot recommend this company.

Having my Medical Guardian around my neck has made me feel a little safer. However, the cable that I put around my neck to which the alarm is fastened to pulls apart. It has a snap on it which keeps coming apart and popping out all the time. So, when I wear it around my neck, lots of time if I don’t have my shirttail in and it comes awry, it falls onto the floor. Also, there was a time I set the alarm off by mistake. I was sitting down with a tray on my lap and I pressed the tray against my chest. It caught right on the button and off went the alarm.

The wearer would have to depress the red button on the side of the watch in order to transmit their location. An Alzheimer's victim wouldn't be able to do this. So I called for a refund and was told it would be done within days and to just keep the watch. I told them I did not want the $99. watch. The rep said, ""Keep it anyway, we'll still refund your money."" Weeks later when checking on the refund I was told I had to return the watch first. I did and still do not have the refund.

My cellphone was the first up, and I just told Medical Guardian everything’s okay.","Original review: Nov. 4, 2018"

My daughter did some research and found that to be the best one. I wear the device on my wrist and I’ve had it for three months. I like it and I have no complaints at all. It feels smaller and it fits better where I have to put it. It would be a good idea for my friends to check into it and I hope they’re as happy as I am.,"Original review: Nov. 3, 2018"

So far, my experience has been fine.","Original review: Nov. 3, 2018"
"Diane of Lyman, ME","Evelyn doesn't get around well by herself and she's pretty much housebound. She knows she's not supposed to get up but sometimes, she does. So the Medical Guardian device was a precaution for her. We checked it out when we first got it. And It doesn't bother her when wearing the device around her neck. However, we were supposed to get the lockbox, which we never did. I reached out to them about that because we're getting charged for it. It's disgusting when you order and pay $37 a month for something, but you don’t get it. Then you call, and they tell you they’ll ship it right out, and you still don’t get it three months later.","Original review: Nov. 2, 2018"

The lady that checked my pacemaker said that if we had a device like this, was it’d be better if I didn’t wear it around my neck because it could get over my pacemaker and might cause it to act up. I’ve gotten used to wearing it and I’m completely satisfied with it.","Original review: Nov. 2, 2018"
"Margaret of Chico, CA","My kids were nagging me of getting a medical alert device because of my medical conditions. And I live alone so they were afraid I would fall. I looked at Medical Guardian. I went online and it was one of the top five, and I kinda trusted that. I always looked at the negative first and then, I looked at the positive comments, and I was impressed. I called them and I got a device immediately. It was easy to set up, and I’ve been wearing it ever since. I accidentally used the button within the first week. I was at a Mexican bar reaching across the table for guacamole, and I accidentally pushed the button against the table. And Medical Guardian's response was immediate. I spoke with their representatives and they were very friendly. I also know other people who have used it, and they’re very happy with it. I was really pleased that I was able to get a gear in advance. So I paid 10 months and got two months free. I’m very happy with Medical Guardian.","Original review: Nov. 1, 2018"

I’m living by myself now and since my son does Medicare supplements, he knows which medical alert company is good and which one isn’t. He wanted Medical Guardian and set me up for it. Since using the device, I feel good because I wear the band so it goes with me wherever I go in the apartment, if I go out to take garbage or if I go to the mail, so I feel very safe.

I have had a therapist to help me overcome some disk issues in my back and she said that I’m so much stronger now than when I moved here that she doesn’t feel the need for her to continue coming once a week. And so, she told me that she was going to release me and I would be okay to continue with the exercises that she gave me and the regimen that I am now doing on my own. I needed the Medical Guardian monitor to make sure that I was okay. The Medical Guardian team was very courteous. They showed me how to do it the first time and I’ve been able to do that.

The ends are sharp and the wire is not strong enough to hold its shape so the ends stick out and scratch my skin. I have to tape it up, which makes it look less than neat. I am very happy that the button does not engage so easily that it goes off unexpectedly. It has to be pushed intentionly. Very satisfied!","Original review: Oct. 23, 2018"

Within 1 1/2 months, our credit card on file was charged $550! In speaking to Guardian about this, they said the Sales rep explained this to my mother (85 yrs old). I am her son, and I can say with 100% certainty that if the Salesperson explained she would get billed $550 (they say the promotion was a full year upfront payment), or even if the device they sent was $50 a month, not the $30 we all expected, we would never have agreed to this.

The device has died several times when I’m in public because the charging port doesn’t charge the device well. It’s obvious some of the individuals that work for their customer service department truly hate their job. There is a lady named Danine at customer service and she was horribly rude to me several times when I’ve called on different occasions. I filed a complaint with the supervisor and she is still being rude.

I then had to convince them to cancel the service. I was told I would be mailed a return label. The return label never arrived. When I was billed for another month, I called back and was told the label was shipped to the wrong address. I then received the label, this time via e-mail. I shipped the equipment back and yet I received another bill. Today I called to ask why I received another bill and was told they have not received the equipment back yet. They know it was shipped but they don't have it yet. So I am now paying three extra months for a service that was never used.

The company admits there is a problem and said they are designing a new docking station but keeps selling garbage. I get alerts that my mother’s device cannot make emergency calls because battery is dead more than 50% of the time. DO NOT BUY THE Active Guardian. I am an accomplished Aerospace Engineer and assure this something that you DO NOT want to use as a life saving device for your parents. More questions, please email me and I will provide a prompt response and can provide video evidence or be willing to talk on the phone.","Original review: July 7, 2018"
"Jen of Los Angeles, CA",This company is grossly incompetent and should not be providing services to the elderly. My 78 year old mother was wearing her Medical Guardian around her neck when she had a fall in the middle of the night. She was lying on the floor and very confused and disoriented because she hit her head but she pushed the button to get help. She spoke to someone 3 different times and she told them she had fallen and could not get up. She was too panicked and confused to have a coherent conversation so they just hung up on her.,"Original review: May 4, 2018"
"Julieta of El Paso, TX",the company responded promptly after this post and resolved the issue. I hope this  issue has prompted them to handle all cancellation as smoothly as possible realizing that when most people cancel the service is mainly due to either memory/debility has worsened in a loved one or a loss of love one either one causes stress and sadness . the last thing one needs is to also experience stress ending a service that is no longer needed. thank you .,"Resolution response: May 4, 2018"
"Bryan of Hopkinsville, KY","If ZERO stars were an option, I would give that rating. To date, we have been charged $1400 for a system that didn't work. We were overcharged the original amount quoted, then the system wouldn't work, then they refunded the incorrect amount, then - after I specifically requested that they simply close the account - they charged us $700 for the ""lost"" units that they had sent us. You know - the units that never worked, and that they never even once told us needed to be returned. This company is NOT trustworthy, and has no idea what they're doing.

"Jacqueline of Waterford, CT","As your parents get older and their health declines, you want to be able to protect them and help them out whenever you can. Unfortunately most of us work during the day, and are unable to take care of our aging parents like we would want to. Medical Guardian alert system has given our family peace of mind knowing that help is available at the push of a button. My dad has only had the system for 5 days and has already needed to use it. He fell early in the morning and used his medical alert system to call for help. Thank goodness for Medical Guardian system because dad wasn't near a phone. The ambulance and paramedics arrived quickly and had dad in a chair before I got there. As far as I'm concerned the system has already paid for itself!!!","Original review: March 22, 2018"

I finally called my salesperson who also tried connecting me to customer service - I WAS TRYING TO ACTIVATE THE SYSTEM. After an hour and 45 minutes I got someone who could not help me, was transferred to a manager who could not help me - who said they would have tech service call me the next day because something was not working with the unit.

"Josephine of Batavia, NY","Fall Detection Pendant - Very dissatisfied with this product. You have to pay extra for the pendant to detect a fall (about $10. a month). Received the pendant, thought all was well. Then for 9 months a fall would be detected when my 91 year old mother was sitting down, in bed or sitting at the dining room table. There was no fall. Then two days ago, she fell. Did the pendant detect the fall? NO. I was told that the pendant DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK and you must press the button on the pendant. Too bad we were not told this. Fortunately she was not hurt and I was in the next room. Will not be continuing with this company.

I wear a Medical Guardian and it's fine. I like it because I go out in the yard and work there in the summertime. It’s nice to feel comfortable about that because sometimes I trip around the yard a little bit. The only thing I don’t like about the bracelet that I have now is the plastic strap that seems to be underneath it sometimes. But I’ll use it until when I make a change at the end of the year then I’d request one that has the velcro on it, which is what I like. I check the device, but not every month, and it’s been great.

It means that they can’t tell where I am within a two block radius or even hundred yard radius. Also one time, I went out to my friend. I put the device on and they couldn’t figure out where I was.

However, it quit working and so he's back to the wristband. Both of the devices have broken at different times and I know how careful he is with things. Also, when we tested the medical device, their response was fine but it took a little bit of time. Other than that, the experience was great.","Original review: June 16, 2017"
"Deann of Redmond, OR","I am a brittle type 1 diabetic with vision problems and other assorted concerns. I'm also out in the far suburbs in central Oregon, 5 miles away from anything and by myself during the day, so having a medical alert is a need. I had an old medical alert provider but I switched to Medical Guardian because I don't have to calibrate and call every month to ensure it's working. Medical Guardian sends the device working and it does. I got their Premim plan and the price is very reasonable. I can also bring the device with me and leave the house so, that's really nice. In addition, their staff has been excellent, friendly and ready to answer questions. On the other hand, the device is about the size of a computer mouse and it'd be nice to have it smaller. I'd love to have something on my wrist but other than that, I'm happy with Medical Guardian.","Original review: June 10, 2017"
"S. of Ca, CA","I live in Gonzales and my son lives in Salinas. The previous device that I had from Medical Guardian will only go 600 feet away from the house, so I switched to the one I have now. But I liked the previous device because it was smaller. The current device on my neck is bigger but it will help me when I’m away from home. I haven’t had to use it and I hope I never have to, but it’s nice to have around. It’s handy and I’m comfortable because I have it. As far as service, I’m having a problem with the green light that keeps going on and off. On Saturday, it woke me up at two o’clock in the morning. I charged it, so it was okay. Then last night before I went to bed, it told me again to charge it. I just put it on right now after charging it for eight hours and it’s still blinking. It’s annoying. I'm supposed to charge it every four days. It's not working right.","Original review: May 29, 2017"
"Deborah of Douglas, GA","I was living alone and I had to have a stent put into the widowmaker, then four months later I had to have a pacemaker. I went online and looked at all of the medical alert devices. The price was better with Medical Guardian, plus I have the necklace and the bracelet and one of them was free. I paid cash for 12 months and that brought the price down as well. Once I got the medical alert device, that gave my daughters some peace of mind. However, I've got clearance from the doctors and everything is well, so I packaged the device up about a month ago and sent it back. It's been three months already and nobody's contacted me since. It was strange that nobody called to say they received it.","Original review: May 14, 2017"
"Buzz of Fort Lauderdale, FL","My wife's doctor had Medical Guardian and offered the best deal. I purchased the one that I hang around the neck.

I would recommend Medical Guardian.","Original review: May 13, 2017"
"Phil of Pittstown, NJ","My mom was having trouble with her foot and she kept tripping over it and falling. She finally agreed that she should have a medical alert device and I got her one from Medical Guardian. The problem with using it is that it causes a scene and embarrasses her. But one time she pressed the button. My sister was there and she told our mom to go to the hospital and find out what's going on. My mom agreed and my sister was about ready to call 911, but she told mom to push the button as it'll get them to the hospital faster, and they did. However, my mom doesn't wear the device anymore. She went in a nursing home that has their own system. I called Medical Guardian, they sent me the return slip, I put the device in UPS and away it went. Everything went well and I'd recommend them.","Original review: May 12, 2017"
"Donna of Havertown, PA","My mom lived with me, but sometimes she is alone by herself and she's unsteady on her feet. I worked at a doctor’s office and one of the patients there sells Medical Guardian and he was talking about it so I got it. She has the wristwatch but sometimes she forgets that she has it on. One time, she was sitting there for an hour waiting for somebody to come help her. I told her she could hit the device and the reps will call me. Overall, the device is easy to use and it’s a comfort knowing that we have it and we can buzz Medical Guardian.","Original review: May 11, 2017"

"Sherwood of Old Saybrook, CT","I had a stroke in 2012, so I was partially weak on the left side. And then last year, I had bacterial pneumonia. I was in intensive care for 12 days on a ventilator. The doctor thought I was not going to make it, but I did. I took a lot of therapy and I’ve gotten back most of my strength, but pneumonia took all my strength and balance. Because my wife was working part-time and didn’t want me walking around the house or going around falling down, I got a Medical Guardian device. She checked out some medical devices and she picked out what she thought would be the best. I’ve been lucky that I haven’t fallen, but having Medical Guardian gives me peace of mind.","Original review: May 7, 2017"

Both my son and daughter chose Medical Guardian and paid for it for the first year. My husband has never used it for an emergency but I punch the button to check if the device is working, and we would always get a prompt return.","Original review: May 6, 2017"
"Patricia of Berlin, MD","I used my Medical Guardian device once because I fell and their team was very pleasant and helpful. They were very prompt in getting here and getting me to the hospital. I was pleased with how fast it went. It's always peace of mind to know that I have it. If I go out or be inside alone, it's nice to have the device. I would wear the necklace but I put it on my own chain because I don't like their little black chain. I also have a bracelet that I wore a couple of times but it doesn’t stay hooked and it's getting in my way catching all my clothes. Other than that, I suggested to my neighbor that she get one because her husband falls a lot. She was pleased with how they came and helped her get her husband off the floor and back in bed. In general, Medical Guardian was great.","Original review: May 5, 2017"

Our mom has both devices for the neck and for the wrist. It's been over a year now and Medical Guardian said that after a year, they were going to upgrade this particular device but that hasn’t happened yet. Other than that, our mom used it a couple of times when she fell and they were here right on time. It makes all of us feel comfortable and we’re very happy and satisfied.","Original review: April 27, 2017"

I just had my 90th birthday and I have arthritis. I also have the shingles and it had paralyzed my eyes and left me with a double vision, so sometimes I can’t find footing when I walk and I could stray. Sometimes in the house, I’m fine but when I go outside I’m not. My kids wanted me to move with them but I don’t want to live with anyone. I’m alone and they’re concerned so Mobile Guardian is a security blanket for me.","Original review: April 26, 2017"

He still thinks it's very good because he keeps asking me how everything's going with that. I said, ""I don't have to use it and I hope I won't have to use it."" But it's comforting to know that it's there. I do try to use it everyday and it works very well. I had to call them because they were calling me in the middle of the night or early. With the time difference, they had it wrong and they were waking me up with calls just to check to see how things were going. ","Original review: April 25, 2017"

And Medical Guardian will come and get me and I’ll be taken care of. I don’t have to get on the phone and call the ambulance or them in Reno. I said, “Oh, that’s great. I’ll take it over once you get through paying it”. I love my medical alert device. I wear it all the time. I have one on my wrist and also have one that I put around my neck.

"Allen of Wheaton, IL","I live alone and my kids were afraid that if I fell, there’s nobody here to help me. My kids investigated Medical Guardian and decided for me. But I’m dissatisfied with the device because you have no way of knowing whether it’s working or when it goes out unless you test it. So, you have a false sense of security. They just say to change it every year. They should build in a low battery thing to tell you to put batteries in.","Original review: April 22, 2017"
"Joseph of The Villages, FL","We wore Medical Guardian but we never had to call them. We returned it because we have an iPhone and an Apple Watch, which covers us anywhere and anytime. We have that in our pockets and we don't pay about $50 a month. I'm 84 and my wife's 80. Since we only participate in different meetings in clubs this summer we needed protection in case we fall at home alone. We've gone through a couple of these things. The one that I had was a cellphone that hangs around my neck and that was a total mobile device. My wife didn't like that heavy pendant around her neck. So it was a small pendant she wore with any home device and it had to be tethered to the mobile unit she carried in her purse with her. It just never worked out.","Original review: April 12, 2017"
"Terryanne of Glendale, CA","I am a post stroke survivor so I have weakness on my left side. I fall frequently and need assistance to get up. I used Medical Alert when I was in Oregon but it needs to have a landline. The one thing that was very attractive in Medical Guardian's service is not needing a landline. When I've had to utilize Medical Guardian, the responder comes on. Typically, my son-in-law is the most able to quickly get me up, he's the strongest in my responder list and when he's going to be at work or on his way to work, I try to get them to call him quickly. I understand Medical Guardian probably has a protocol or checklist of things to ask me but I just want to get them to call him so there have been times where I wanted to cut through all that and to just call my son-in-law. They just kept asking and stuck to the protocol list.","Original review: April 2, 2017"

"Jean of Casper, WY","When I just got out of the hospital, my sister found Medical Guardian on the internet. I have COPD and my husband is still working, so he’s gone a lot and I'm alone a lot, but I feel a bit more comfortable now because of the Medical Guardian device. I have a little box that I set on my end table and a necklace with a little button on it that I make sure to have with me if he's going to be gone. But it gets tangled up with my oxygen tubing. I'm afraid I'm going to bump the alarm into something and set it off. My concern is if it is being paid for because last month, I looked and didn't see where they had taken out any payments for a couple of months now.","Original review: Oct. 13, 2016"

"Mike of Broken Arrow, OK","My wife has become weak, she has a liver disease and a kidney disease, and she’s also had surgery on her back. She doesn’t get around very well. She was falling a lot and I had to run home from work every day at lunchtime to pick her up off the floor. So, we got the Medical Guardian. The police/fire station is right down the street. So they’re usually there before I can get home and have gathered her up off the floor and on their way. Having the device helped her by being able to get somebody there quickly to pick her up and get her out of the floor instead of waiting for me to drive home.","Original review: Oct. 7, 2016"
"Susan of Lagrangeville, NY","My mom is not exactly steady on her feet, but she persists in going up and down stairs and doing other things around the house. Having her have a Medical Guardian leaves the rest of us feeling like we don’t have to watch her every minute. As opposed to other medical devices, Medical Guardian was one of the more highly recommended from the nursing home and our county office that they’ve had good results. My mom has the device that goes around her neck and the one that goes around her wrist. The last thing I saw was the one around her neck. She took the wrist one off most recently. We tested the device once or twice and it was wonderful. The reps were great. They were informative and they listened. We haven’t really used the Medical Guardian yet, but it’s nice to know that it’s there.","Original review: Oct. 3, 2016"
"Sue of York, PA","My mother's Medical Guardian device has a GPS unit. I like that she could walk away from it and if she got in the car, she could take it with her. She makes sure that the device is close to her by wearing her necklace or bracelet. The necklace has a magnet and she simply pops it on. She had a situation where she leaned into the counter and had the necklace on 'set it off'. Somebody called her right away which startled her but she’s surprised that they really are responsive. She likes her medical alert device.","Original review: Oct. 1, 2016"

I returned the device. They received it back after the 10 day return policy. The device was NEVER used, put on or even activated. They charged me $179.85 which was the 3 month charges if not return within 10. When I call the dispute charge they would not even work with me or reissue the returned device that I paid 3 months of service. This company is a rip off. I just want all new customers beware. This might be a good product but very bad customer service and will not work with you to resolve any issue. FYI, LifeAlert much better and Great customer relations.

I have the same set that she has and was told that if you are in the yard they will call your home phone and if you don't answer they will call 911. If you are laying in the yard and can't get up, how can you answer the phone. I was even told that if you are in another room away from the base unit they will follow same procedure.","Original review: Feb. 2, 2016"
"Daniel of Madison, WI","All aspects of my purchase for my senior mother's security system were handled very well except for one. The owner's instruction manual is awful. And incomplete. I write and edit technical material for a living and if anyone on my team submitted such a manual, I would fire them. The instructions are wholly incomplete. There is no reference to how to connect a telephone cable -- an essential step. Nor is there any reference to the on/off switch on the back of the device -- another item of essential information. When I compare the manual to the actual device, it's as if the writer/editor of the manual had never actually connected a device. The manual is pathetically useless. I hope your service is much better than the manual. Also, when we tested the service the response was very slow... worrisome, really. You may be sure that I will convey this same information to Consumer Reports and my contacts at AARP and The New York Times.","Original review: Jan. 4, 2016"

"donna of Monticello, GA","We had purchased the Medical Guardian protection for my mother (71) who tends to fall. On April 11th we were at her house visiting and she took a bad fall. She was wearing her Medical Guardian device and it never went off. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital where she had bleeding on the brain and a broken shoulder and a fractured elbow. After extensive medical care, she is now in hospice and is expected to pass any day. We specifically held out to get this device for her because of the motion detection. Again, the device never went off to alert for medical help. If we had not been there she probably would have bled out. I know it is not the device's fault for the extensive injuries but what if we had not been there? I never thought that an independent woman like my mother would end up in passing away from a fall. What a tragedy.","Original review: May 20, 2015"

My children and doctor thought it might be a good idea since I'm 86 years old and alone. At first I had the one around the neck and I found that to be very sensitive. I barely touched it and it went off. So that’s why I got the wrist one. But I understand also they have another wrist one that is thinner. I don’t know whether I’m going to be happy with the bracelet because it is rather thick. But I’ll wait and see. Perhaps I’ll just get used to it.

She had a different one before where she was living but when she moved down with us, we couldn’t take that one because it was through a hospital. This has made a great deal of difference because with the medical device, we can leave the house. Before, we didn’t want to leave because we weren’t sure if she fell, how long she’d be laying there before one of us come back and go for her, so it’s been not just for her but for us too. When my husband had to get it initially activated, they were very helpful and the one time that it went off, they called and the machine did whatever it’s supposed to do.

I was completely dissatisfied.,"Original review: Dec. 9, 2014"

My parents had difficulty hooking it up and when I spoke to the representative over the phone, everybody said it was very easy. They weren't able to do it on their own so they had to have someone come in and do it for them. But it's comfortable as far as they don't realize that it's on anymore. We're satisfied.","Original review: Dec. 8, 2014"

"Peter of Port St. Lucie, FL","I needed a medical alert device because I'm getting old. So wherever I am, if something happens, I can reach them. Before using Medical Guardian, I haven’t used another medical alert service, but since using it, I haven’t felt more secure. Also, I had a lot of trouble at the beginning. Their customer service was atrocious to say the least. I couldn't get through them and the agent who sold it to me kept saying to me, ""Call me first, don't call the company,"" but that was a little unusual. ","Original review: Dec. 1, 2014"

"David of Baltimore, MD","My father had something previously but it only covered him in the house and he's still an active person who needed coverage outside of the house. We got the other device from the hospital in Roswell. When we expressed our concerns with the coverage from that device, they suggested that we contact Medical Guardian. Now with the Guardian alert device, my dad feels far more comfortable leaving the house and doing what he normally does because he knows he has protection. It has been a good thing for him and has increased his independence. He gets to charge it at night and just carries it with him. It's part of his routine now which is good. It's pretty comfortable and easy for him to use and I've heard no complaints. Everything was great. I appreciate the independence that it is allowing my dad to have. We would recommend Medical Guardian. It would be nice though if they would have some kind of technology that would indicate if somebody has fallen and that his position has shifted dramatically and somebody could get help.

It's great with the GPS tracking and a good system. I ordered, paid, and it came the next day. They get right to the point. You call them, and on the same day they're on the phone.

We have used another alert system for a while but it only worked in the homes and I wanted something mobile that I could carry with me so I had something on me all the time. So I got the Medical Guardian medical alert device. I wear it around my neck all the time. I was gonna call and ask about the bracelet though because sometimes at night it gets wrapped around my neck and it almost chokes me. But since using it, I get the peace of mind knowing it's there if I need it. Everything has been fine. I've pushed the button a couple times by accident and the Medical Guardian team answered very quickly and were very nice about it. They were helpful and answered all my questions.

"V. of Va, VA","I've had a very good experience with Medical Guardian. I only got it because my neighbors insisted that I get it. I'm living alone and my balance is not really good. So if I fell, I needed to know that I could get in touch with somebody. There was one time when I accidentally set the alarm off when I was in a restaurant and did not know that I had set it off. I was very pleased to know that the paramedics arrived and that it works just beautifully. I don't mind wearing the watch or the necklace but I don't like having to carry the other thing with me. I also don't like the necklace which I ordered first because it interferes if you want to wear jewelry around your neck. I wanted to get the watch and did have a little trouble getting a contact to do that. ","Original review: Nov. 23, 2014"

The kids were worried about leaving me by myself so I wear it. Since I had Medical Guardian, they don't call me that often. They were worried about me and they would call me every 30 minutes. Having it also makes me more careful because I don't want to fall somewhere and not be able to call them. You kind of watch your steps closer because I have fallen three or four times. It is a good thing. We tested it and the button works. I had a good experience using it. ","Original review: Nov. 23, 2014"

Then he said “When you gave us all your information, what did you think?” I have several other bills that have all my information and I still call them to let them know about the payment. They don’t take it out on their own. When I first called Medical Guardian, this guy was very nice and naturally he wanted to make the sale. But now he turned me off over this payment.

My right leg isn't good yet so when I get up, I have awful trouble standing. But other than that, I don't like to go outside because I got to hang on to everything. Medical Guardian is the only thing with that little microphone thing. It's a pain running around with it but it's alright. I got a fall pendant that is okay but most of the time I forget to move it when I need to. The other one I had a better, louder speaker on it and you didn't have to move it around so much. Ii was one which you plug in the wall and you can't take it out of the house and that's why I switched to the Medical Guardian. It's just that I've got several spots in my house that unless I take that microphone with me, they can't hear me. When I am using my bathroom, they don't hear me that well. I took off the pendant and the thing went off. The microphone went off and they got to call me because they couldn't hear me and they can't turn it up.

Their people were very gracious and informed. It was a good experience. Their button comes with a black necklace type and I wear it all the time even when I sleep. I don't like it because it has gotten stretched out to the point that the shortest I can maneuver it is probably close to my belly button, and that's not acceptable. Other than that, everything works okay. It gives me a sense of security and that means a lot to me.

But I make sure that I have the mobile unit with me at all times and I wear it constantly around my neck. Otherwise what's the point of having it? ","Original review: Nov. 7, 2014"
"Fran of Baldwinsville, NY","I'm more confident knowing that no matter where I am, Medical Guardian can find me through the GPS system. It makes me feel comfortable to know I can be traced.","Original review: Nov. 7, 2014"
"Bruce of Agoura Hills, CA","We received good information during our first contact with Medical Guardian and decided to obtain the Mobile Guardian setup for an elderly grandmother. She is easily confused by technology, but can easily operate the home, wrist, and necklace devices. This gives the family comfort, knowing she can easily call for help if needed, and allows her to live independently. The only improvement we'd like would be a volume control on the home device. It is not loud enough to be heard throughout the house, although the operator can pickup her voice.","Original review: Nov. 7, 2014"
"Richard of Tucson, AZ","I decided NOT to go ahead with my order of last Friday, the 31st of Oct. I emailed my agent Guy ** who said call customer service, which I did, and they assured me the order was cancelled. The next thing I see is 34.95 deducted from my checking account. Question: Was the necklace shipped? It will be refused and come back to you. When does my $34.95 get refunded back to my account. Not the way to make a good first impression on a possible future customer. Believe me I think that possibility does not longer exist.","Original review: Nov. 7, 2014"
"Renee of Beverly Hills, CA","It was my mother's idea for me to get a medical alert system because when my husband travels and If I have a fall she was concerned about me breaking bones because I am thin. I researched all of the companies and found that Medical Guardian was voted #1. When I called to inquire about the system I spoke to a very positive, knowledgeable person who directed me to the right product for me. I received it in 2 days, followed the instructions for set up which was very easy. I then tested the unit and tested it again a week later. I was then contacted to see if I was satisfied which I really appreciated. So I would recommend Medical Guardian to anyone who is alone and would like the security of this monitoring system.","Original review: Nov. 7, 2014"

"John of Henderson, NV","I followed The set up Guidelines today and called the 800 number. I was put on hold then told to leave my # and someone would call me back with in an hour. 90 minutes later I called them back and did talk to a rep. We did the set up and then did a test. It worked just fine but, If you were in real trouble forget it. They were very slow to answer. (More than a minute) Oh the first call to the set up dept. was never returned. The staff (When I got them on the line) was very helpful but the respond time was slow. If you have a real emergency call 911. This is a good back up system when you do not need a $1,500 ambulance ride and worth peace of mind. I think it's a good value. Yes, I would give it 3 stars.","Original review: Nov. 6, 2014"
"Anita of Bothell, WA","I bought this for my husband in preparation for when he comes home from the rehab center. I've had the system for over a week when I was more or less forced to activate it. Well, my husband is still not home, but my cat playfully knocked the pendant off the shelf one night and immediately I received a phone call from Rapid Response to confirm if everything was fine or not. I reassured him that all was fine. No one fell, and I was hiding the pendant until my husband gets home to make use of it. I'm happy to say the system works! Thank you.","Original review: Nov. 6, 2014"
"Leah of Dayton, OH","I spoke on behalf of my father, Elwood **, when I ordered a Medical Guardian alert system. At the time of ordering, the sales person assured me he would have sent a wristband version of the device. When the device arrived, the version was a pendant. Still, we went ahead with conducting a test of the equipment and, at that time, I explained to the operator with whom I spoke that we had not received the wristband version as had been promised. She assured me that a wristband device would be sent out. MORE IMPORTANTLY, during the test, our wait time was over two minutes--my father can do better than that just using his cell phone. THIS IS NOT AT ALL LIKE THE SERVICE PROMISED IN YOUR ADS. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.","Original review: Nov. 6, 2014"
"Ann of Bermuda Dunes, CA","I checked on-line when searching for a system to protect me as I live alone, and often go bike riding, long distances. I then called 5 or 6 of the medical alert companies that I found and spoke to their representatives... asking the same questions of each. Where they were located... did they outsource their call center, if so, where. I refuse to do business with any company that uses call centers outside the USA. Then I inquired about the GPS, the range, & last the cost. I then chose Medical Guardian as having the best answers.","Original review: Nov. 6, 2014"
"Mark of New York, NY","My mom started falling a lot and she refused to let me order the Medical Guardian for her, saying it was for old people (she's 73.). Then she fell outside after visiting a doctor and was in a remote area, unable to get up. She had to call 911 for assistance. I didn't ask again, I just ordered the system and brought it to her house and set it up. She is SO thankful. She feels more confident knowing that assistance is just a push button away. Thanks for providing such a great service!","Original review: Nov. 6, 2014"

"V. of Ca, CA","I'm using Medical Guardian because I had a fall recently. I tripped and fell and hurt my knee. I just turned 90 and don't have the stability that I used to have in walking and doing things. Also a couple of weeks later, I fell out of bed and landed on the same knee and really wrecked it. My family wanted me to have something if I should fall. I'm glad to have it and I feel more secure. It seems to be very good because I had to activate it and I also pressed it to find out if it was working when I first got it and it all seems to be in good order. I'm wearing the necklace. The watch was too heavy for me because my wrists are thin. They need to make different sized watches. I can always tuck the necklace inside my shirt. Although I'm wondering - there's a black string that came with it. Would I be able to wash that without getting the button itself wet?","Original review: Nov. 6, 2014"
"Tina of Albany, GA","My mother-in-law tried to call, tried to use it and couldn't get anybody to respond. She is 78. She's immobile and falls a lot. What happened was she fell and when she fell, she mashed the button that's on her necklace. She was lying probably about 3 feet from the machine. She kept hollering for the guy to hear that she fell and nobody ever answered or responded to her. So she called me and I had to go there because she couldn't get anybody to respond. It's only after we get there that they finally responded and I said it's time... finally, to be responding. So we're not happy at all with Medical Guardian. On top of that we've been waiting now for about 9 days for the technical support to give us a callback. When I called the guy, he said he was on his way into the office, that he would give me a call as soon as he got there. I haven't heard from him since.","Original review: Nov. 5, 2014"
"Louise of Las Vegas, NV","The Medical Guardian is wonderful. I accidentally hit it with my fickle finger of fate and called them but didn't need them so I right away righted that but it has made us feel so much more secure. After just hitting it twice a little bit with my finger, they were there and that was wonderful. We got the medical alert device because my husband is 96 and I'm 84 and I ended up with a broken hip last year. I was in the hospital for 7 months. I got out but not as stable as I was, and I figured we needed it. We're on walkers when we need to be any distance and that's working out fine, but you're not always ready for things that you don't know are going to happen and we both feel better with Medical Guardian","Original review: Nov. 5, 2014"
"Richard of Muncie, IN","I needed a medical alert device due to falling down. But I won’t start Medical Guardian again till next month. I haven’t got it turned on - just had it cut, set off for a couple of months. I wear the bracelet on my arm, though it’s not the one I wanted because I’m allergic to brass. They got the one that’s got a clip on it, like a belt buckle, but I want an elastic one that I can stretch over my hand. I didn’t get it yet.","Original review: Nov. 4, 2014"
"Juanita of Augusta, GA","My son got me the Medical Guardian alert device. I feel more secure when I have it with me when I leave the house. Everyone that sees me with it would ask me, ""What is that?"" and I’d tell them.","Original review: Nov. 3, 2014"

"Janice of Lynn, MA","I had lung disease that led to a neuropathy that took away my ability to walk. I'm happy to say that I'm slowly getting my ability to walk back. I left the hospital and the rehab center after 52 days and came home. My family was concerned about when I was going to be home alone even for an hour. They were worried so eventually, we got the Medical Guardian. The ordering process went smoothly. For the most part, my husband did all of that and he didn't seem to have any trouble with it. They seemed to have a quick response on getting back to us.","Original review: Oct. 31, 2014"
"Charlotte of Tulsa, OK","I've had three back operations and I have to walk with a cane and I fell a lot and me being here at the house by myself during the day, we decided to go ahead and get a Medical Guardian for my safety and my husband's frame of mind. I haven’t actually had to use it, thank God, but I wear it everyday. I mainly use the one with the clip. I clip it on my waistband because I'm in and out a lot and I don't stay home too much but I wanted something that I could have with me if I got in my car and went somewhere. When I get in the shower, however, I'll wear my wristband. So far, it's been okay. I'm very satisfied with it. I'm very thankful that I have it. I feel safe at home and in my car. And I know that if I need help, I'll get it.","Original review: Oct. 30, 2014"
"Katherine of Akron, OH","My mother is 90 years old and she'd had several admissions to the hospital and had a fall at home. Since she started using Medical Guardian, there's a little less stress and some sense of a little bit of security when I'm not with her. In the beginning she was a little nervous because it's technology. At 90, she's not used to technology. But she's gotten very used to wearing it and I keep the bracelet in the bathroom for her so that if something should happen to her when she's in the bathroom and she doesn't have the necklace on, she has the bracelet available. She's never had to use it so thank God.","Original review: Oct. 29, 2014"
"Miriam of Richmond, VA","Medical Guardian worked the way it's supposed to. They responded by contacting medical people, and they came to my house. But the advertising is wrong. They only advertise it as a thing you wear around your neck, but there's the other little thing that needs to be charged every night so I reminded them that it takes three pieces and not just one. But I'd recommend them.","Original review: Oct. 27, 2014"
